negative,"It's works but does not fit perfectly, will probably end up breaking quickly.",20
negative,"[[VIDEOID:937a87d5e9d3fe284036086fb80fa282]] I only had this item for three months.  It started to make the loudest noise after it dumped the ice into the holding tray.  Of course, the return window has passed, and the 90-day warranty is up.  If you are considering purchasing this ice maker, I would strongly NOT recommend it.",20
positive,I ordered without looking at the description.  My counter tops sit quite a bit lower than top of stove.  I even tried to lower stove to level out but the legs were already flush.  I think my granite is just thinner than most counter tops so these items will not work for my application.  They also seem really wide which detracts a little for me.<br />I liked the idea of metal vs silicone but I think the silicone maybe the forgiving way to go in my kitchen.,20
positive,,20
positive,I like it,20
positive,Works great. No refrigerator repair person needed,20
positive,"The one in my rental units dryer fell out, and I was drying shoes and some other things and it broke it. I am so glad I found this one because it fits better than the old one ever did.",20
positive,"Water so clean, it tastes like it came from the stream. Seriously- Sulfur tasting water is a thing of the Past!",20
positive,saved me a fortune on a service call solved the problem works like new,20
positive,fits right away,20
negative,Broken and a complete waste of money....,20
positive,Very expensive but did the trick and the lighting is now back to normal‚Ä¶‚Ä¶really need to find generic alternative that doesn‚Äôt cost this much.,20
positive,Works perfectly!,20
positive,Shape of element is different than what was posted on Amazon. However still functional.,20
positive,Perfect,20
positive,I like that it filters extremely well so no debris goes in the cup,20
positive,"During the spinning cycle when using the small basket, the whole instrument trembles making a loud noise. Besides that it is a very powerful machine. I love it.",20
negative,I wished I would‚Äôve written this long ago but I bought this refrigerator in 2016. Within a year the icemaker started freezing up. I had a local repair service replace the unit with one that Samsung provided for $300. I felt like it should have been free but I purchased it anyway. Within three months it was also freezing up. The repair person tried to contact Samsung service about it and was unsuccessful. Other than that I love the refrigerator but one star for faulty part and not making it right!,20
positive,"I have only been using this unit for one day, but it already far exceeds my expectations.  It is many times better than the very expensive GE Brand, I had 4 of those and never did get one to work.  This one makes ice quickly, easy to clean, big water take and is quite.  I will do another review in a month just to see how it is going since it is new to me right now.  Don‚Äôt hesitate to buy, perfect so far.",20
positive,"I knew nothing about installing this product, but it was very easy once I figured out how to take the washing machine cover off. FYI, each washing machine is different just use your brain lol!",20
negative,Purchased 2 of these and unfortunately they both came dented,20
negative,Worse than drinking straight from the tap.,20
positive,"Great value, perfect fit.  Still working after 7 months.",20
positive,"Great little filters, no more grains only pure coffee...",20
positive,Worked well!,20
positive,Works great üëç,20
negative,"From this week on, the range hood often goes downtime intermittently: when my wife was cooking, the machine suddenly went down on its own, and the button didn't respond and couldn't be restarted. It could be started after a period of time (such as an hour). This phenomenon occurs more and more frequently. Bad experience, I has applied for repair, if the manufacturer can not solve, I will make a high claim from Amazon.com.",20
positive,Really happy with this egg storage bin.  Love that it has a drawer so you dont have to pull the unit out of fridge to get an egg.  It is sturdy so you can set things on top of it.  I recommend this item.,20
positive,Very functional. Performs it's intended functions. Very nice for the money and works very well,20
positive,I have gotten these replacements more then once.  Great value,20
positive,"I ordered this product because I was not satisfied by the drain hose that was included in my new Whirlpool washing machine. This product is well designed and well made; quite sturdy. The end that connects to the washer is universal and is designed to fit different drain sizes; I cut the end to suit my washer. This is fine. The hose clamp that is included is an aircraft quality hose clamp; my choice forall applications that require a hose clamp.<br /><br />Overall, a very good product and I recommend this product!",20
positive,I ordered this for our keurig 2.0 oasis(K200) and we absolutely love the items. With ours I tested out the reusable filter cups without using the full menu clip and they worked fine. I think that if you're looking for reusable filters for Kcup and Kcarafe this is the way to go. You get everything you need and it's a great deal.<br />I would definitely recommend this!,20
positive,"Work perfectly.  2 for the normal 1 price.  A serious design flaw means these filters get clogged quickly.  I use a soft brush and my shop vac to clean the filter each time I empty the canister.  Even still, I have to replace this filter periodically.",20
positive,"It's everything I was looking for in a compact washing machine. Really does a great job getting my things clean!  Also love how easy it is to move around.  The spin/dry feature is wonderful too! I am very happy with my purchase, which by the way, is very reasonably priced for what you get.  I've used it quite a few times already and actually enjoy doing my laundry now!  Thank you for this great little machine!",20
negative,"First filter I bought was great, made the water taste like the GE filter. The second one however makes the water taste like plastic....",20
positive,good,20
positive,great replacement filter,20
positive,So happy with these filters.,20
negative,"I bought this for a Frigidaire air conditioner.  Once received, the D section to fit over the unit/knob was not long enough.",20
positive,Exact replacement for my Aprilaire 500,20
positive,"This device works great especially with pots and pans designed for Induction. I purchased a number if the T-Fal pans that has the induction logo and they are very good. My only criticism of the Max Burton is with the granularity of the settings. The jumps between temperature settings could be finer. Hence four stars and not five.<br /><br />My main reason for purchasing the Max Burton was to see how well induction cookers perform. I am in the market for a new stove top  or complete stove, and based on my experiences with the Max Burton, I will definitely be purchasing an induction cook top or complete stove.<br /><br />It amazes me that these devices are not more popular in the US as they are in Europe. Having read some of the reasons people give e.g. needing special pots etc. rather stupid. A parallel can be drawn here with the excuses for not buying Diesel automobiles. Again, rather stupid.",20
negative,Water flows very very slow...takes 3x longer to make a pot of coffee..disappointed,20
positive,The product makes plenty of perfect ice. Set up was easy with the correct parts.,20
negative,"Partially shipped, never received the full order, and can‚Äôt get a replacement or a refund .. highly disappointed..",20
negative,This product has serious safety issues! Buy it only if you are tired of your life! I really do not understand why Amazon let such a low quality product to still be on its site!! Obviously safety of customers has no priority here :((,20
positive,"[[VIDEOID:ce138567ae346678f73b2513e773a64b]] Small enough for counter, big enough for two people's dishes, glassware, & silverware.  Quiet, and very very  clean dishes.",20
negative,"My filter only lasted a month, very disappointing. I have order from seller before with no issuse, maybe my mine was defective. But disappointing since it was $50 and one would hope they last longer.",20
positive,Replaced 20 year old bulbs in Kenmore (Whirlpool) over/under freezer/refrigerator in the fridge section.  Fits in the slot length and width and illuminates similar to a restaurant/store cold drink fridge.  Not super bright but clearly.  Seems our food is easier to see now.,20
positive,Best price,20
positive,Arrived timely and in good condition. Fit my Samsung refrigerator perfectly. Rated NSF standard 53 which removes most chemical contaminates. Recommended.,20
positive,"Bought for my kennmore dishwasher, works great. Exactly what I expected. Very large so measure to make sure it fits. Fits all our silverware for our big family.",20
positive,Worked perfectly.  I also got one for  friend.,20
positive,"No real complaints, some of the abbreviations in the LED display could be clearer, I have to look up till I memorize but otherwise does the job. I have to say the sensor is very responsive, as soon as I open the door to the terrarium it immediately sense is a change in humidity and activates the humidifier connected to it",20
positive,Does the job,20
positive,Direct replacement. Would have thought the indicator that shows you when to replace the filter would have come with the filters.,20
positive,zi like this product because it keeps my coffee maker from undesired taste,20
positive,This is the best little ice maker ever<br />Makes little ice cubes and larger ice cubes,20
positive,Look just as described,20
positive,"Makes ice pretty quickly. I definitely recommend cleaning with lemon juice before use, because ours had a plastic taste. Once I let lemon juice sit in the water storage tank and ran some through the machine it was fine. Love the machine.",20
negative,"This product did get my dryer fixed, however two of the rollers that came with the kit did not fit the axles on my dryer. The back two are different size than the front two, The belt tensioner on my dryer was the problem that needed replacing and that worked out fine, however since I had the dryer completely apart, I wanted to go ahead and change out the four rollers as well. I could only change out two of them. All in all though, it did get my dryer back working.",20
positive,Nice customer service,20
positive,switch was correct part .packed well .price was about one half the store price saved a lot of time thanks<br />Frigidaire 134936800 lock switch for washer,20
positive,"Took a while to find this part as LG changed/discontinued the original part number for my gas range top. This replacement fit perfectly for my model LG gas range top. The anodized coating for the original griddle and this replacement is not as durable as it should be, so I expect I will need another griddle plate in 4-5 years. :( The next gas range will have a more durable griddle.",20
positive,"Did not purchase to be a milk frother, instead I use it for candle making. These are very nice and great quality.",20
positive,This is a great tool for doing what we don't do often enough - clean coils under our fridge.  Used on a Whirlpool & a Samsung.  Did the trick.,20
negative,"These did not fit my stove even though the listing states it would fit my Fridgidare stove.  It's nearly impossible to find ""universal"" replacement knobs for a stove.  All I needed was the connector that fits inside the knob to the mechanism on the stove.  I threw money away on these.  Do not order.  They will not work for you.",20
positive,Works perfectly with our Kenmore Fridge! and a super price,20

positive,Worked great for my Norcold N611RT refrigerator. Worked in both freezer and fridge. Fit perfectly.,20
positive,I like the price.  This was for a washer drain pump.,20
negative,Just over a year old and the entire inside is filled with mold in places that I can not reach. Worked great until this happened,20
negative,"I have a Sears/Kenmore humidifier, and posted plainly on the humidifier is this model number. However, it's the right height, right width, but wrong length. The top rests on the filter. This filter, being too short, does not support the top. I need a filter, Model # 32-14912, that is 2.5 inches wide, 11 inches tall, and apparently, at least 12 inches long. These fllters are 6.5 inches long.  A decent picture accompanying this product would also be VERY helpful!",20
positive,Easy to install and work well,20
positive,The product appears to be well made. Super easy to use right out of the box! We‚Äôve had it 4 days and it has made my husband super happy!I am using specially filtered water in hopes of improving the lifetime of the machine.,20
positive,Perfect fit for my piece of junk Samsung refrigerator.,20
positive,I like product because it fit what I order it for and fast delivery  thank u Amazon,20
positive,works great! my freezer is working again!,20
positive,Size is perfect for making paint thickness froth for cappuccinos and macchiatos.,20
positive,the cabinet hood is totally what i expected it to look like...it's perfect for my newly renovated kitchen..the stainless steel hood is easier to clean .,20
positive,"Love love love this little washer! Was recommended by a neighbor. If you live off grid with solar,  this is the washer for you!!!",20
positive,Boxes falling apart as I opened packaging. I had to tape the individual boxes that hold each filter. What‚Äôs up with that????,20
positive,igniter works great fits perfect  for my frigidaire stove/oven easy to install,20
positive,fast shipping...as described. fits our refrigerator fine..I was concerned that it might not fit our maytag ref but it did.,20
positive,I liked everything about what I purchase from Amazon have not had a problem at all,20
positive,"I really enjoy cooking with the Verona. Has so many functions that can accommodate every kind of recipe!!<br />It fit perfectly in the position that I needed. The customer service was outstanding!  I spoke with Robert several times and he was an absolutely wonderful person to talk with, felt like we became friends. Very, Very happy!!",20
positive,Arrived a day early and does exactly what it was designed to do.  Easy install.,20
positive,Came on time. Just as described. Works fabulous,20
positive,I have sulfur water which is very difficult to drink without a very good filter.  This refrigerator filter is doing a great job. I am very pleased with this purchase and will continue to order this product.,20
positive,"The thermal fuse worked perfect, however there was something bigger wrong with our dryer so it blew again a few days later. The price was good and delivery was fast.",20
positive,Just what I needed to fix our oven. Great price quick delivery,20
positive,Authentic GE replacement part at a better price.,20
positive,Ok for replacement parts,20
positive,Works just like it should very happy,20
positive,"I love these bowls and lids. This was my 2nd time purchasing these bowls, just needed a few more than I had. One bowl from the assorted set was cracked, told seller, sent pics and they sent another set! Very fast. Thanks so much. Will be purchasing from them again in the future.",20
positive,Good quality element and your installation video was a big help.,20
positive,its going to take a while its no surprise your only using 12v to heat its up trust me i work on electrical things,20
positive,Works as advertised!,20
positive,"Fits perfectly, the quality does seems to be better than the oem filter.",20
negative,"Hi,<br />Product was as expected just one minor item missing, no USB to make sure firmware upgrades to see new fan. Kind of disappointed!!",20
positive,Depending on the washer you own it can be tedious but definitely worth it. The hard part is getting to the part and putting the washer back together. Replacing the part itself took 2 screws and 2 twist-ties. Total time was about an hour and I had a working washer. To call a repair man would have been days to weeks of waiting plus the add expense of a laundromat. This was much cheaper and faster. Google and YouTube are your friends!,20
positive,Just the right size took longer than expected to get it delivered.,20
positive,"I needed a 6"" shift of my dryer vent and this did a good job I ended up twisting the corners to keep it from moving after installation. It's light weight but still working fine",20
positive,Arrived quickly. I have no idea how I lost my filter. I just know it will reappear one day soon but glad ro get a replacement at a reasonable price with a plunger to boot. Guess they like to wear out over time so I'm all set there when the time comes.,20
positive,"I like it, it will be bigger than now.",20
positive,The tabs on this plastic part have a tough job to do in the dishwasher (holding up the top rack) so it's no surprise when they break off. The replacement is simple so finding them on Amazon makes keeping a stable top rack easy.,20
positive,Perfect fit for my Keurig.  This piece should be inspected often for splitting and dirtiness. This was the absolute best price for these seals as well.,20
negative,Freezes beverages and never stops running.,20
positive,Perfect fit and function. Would highly recommend and will buy again if needed.,20
positive,Works great with the Bee House Ceramic Coffee Dripper!,20
positive,Works as it should.,20
positive,Great value,20
positive,Works well,20
positive,Works good  just expensive,20
positive,Great product.  Sound level about the same as a faucet running.  Had a problem with the hinge but seller took care of it immediately. Make ice very quickly.,20
positive,"[[VIDEOID:d4b930f8f0fa7ba032dbbb2b2ff75e78]] Updating my review here, I‚Äôve had this dishwasher a little over 6 months now. Fits well in small spaces and is runs quietly. But recently I started getting E1 and E4. I was concerned maybe it was kicking the bucket on me, but after messing around with it I had to stop using detergents. Occasionally I add a little vinegar to water for cleaning., anyways it‚Äôs back up to running normally . I did attempt to go back to detergents but it happened again. I believe it‚Äôs the episom salt in the detergent clogging the line. This line is smaller then the bigger ones. Detergents harden which causes the error messages. I use a little bacon soda along with a few drops of dish  detergent works just as good to clean your dishes. Do not put more then a couple of drops or it will over sud. A few drops goes along way in dishwashers. Also make sure you get food out of dishes. I have had this dishwasher for more then a year now or going on two. It still working.",20
positive,Very good quality magnet,20
positive,"UPDATE. AT THE ONE YEAR POINT IT JUST DIED. JUST PAST THE WARRANTY OF COURSE. PICK SOMETHING ELSE. Makes consistent ice cubes in two sizes. I like how it looks in my countertop as well!! So far, so good!",20
positive,The product arrived on time and all seems well.  It took me a few tries to get it properly installed - it takes a little strength to get it in and turned.  Once installed it seems to be working fine.  Water is nice and clean.,20
negative,"The end of the wiring of the new motor fan didn‚Äôt fit on my hood vent, had to cut the end of the wiring on the old motor fan and tape it to the new motor fan so I could get it to work.<br /><br />Not ideal, all the numbers matched too and everything. But it works now after getting it installed.<br /><br />Update: Fan stopped working after less than 2 months, 1/5 stars.",20
negative,"I did not buy this washer from Amazon, I bought it from Home Depot but I feel compelled to write this review.  My purchase was made on July 4, 2020.  I did not receive the machine until September 16, 2020 due to backorder.  From soon after delivery date until present, it has leaked from the bottom 5 times.  LG sends a technician out to look at it and that's all that happens.  It doesn't leak when he is here so he says that he can't fix what he doesn't see.  Beware!  This machine is listed as DISCONTINUED on Home Depot's website however, I see it is still available at Best Buy, Sear's Outlet/American Freight, was available until today at Lowe's and still obviously available here at Amazon.  DISCONTINUED means the model had issues and when it needs parts, you will likely be told that LG doesn't manufacture that part anymore so too bad for you!  Stay away from this machine!",20
positive,"Bought this as a replacement for a similar style one-cup coffee maker.  The water doesn't drip through quite as rapidly, as the surface area of the base is not as large, but it works well.  Tip:  Don't be fooled into thinking you've got to use one of those cone-shaped coffee filters with this, however.  Just use a regular sized drip coffee maker filter, fold it in quarters, fit it into the plastic cone and open it, and add the coffee in one of the &#34;pockets.&#34;  So much more economical than those expensive name-brand filters.",20
positive,These are a direct fit in my fridge.  I would have paid $49 for ONE filter at a box store.  These four were slightly less.  Great product and great price.,20
positive,These replacement wheels work great. The old wheels are removed very easy and the new ones are installed very easy.,20
positive,As described,20
positive,Coffee brews thru better. Love them,20
negative,Came Broken!,20
positive,This is a nice coverup for my old dishwasher.,20
positive,"It seems like it's in defrost mode as much as it's making ice. I wanted to run it a few times before writing this. 2 hours gets you about half a basket of ice, it's better to transition it to the freezer once defrost mode kicks on or your ice will get wet or is in the process of melting, not sure which. You can tell by the sound the machine makes approximately when it's getting close to the defrost time.  It will make kind of a squeaking/strained noise.<br /><br />I like it because it means less ice trays in the freezer.  We did have to find an out of the way spot to run it because it's big, but since it can have a water supply or just filling the resivour, it can be placed just about anywhere.<br />I would recommend this for those who like nugget ice, I like it because I can have just ice with the squeeze flavor and it's like a snow cone in a cup.",20
positive,Just what I wanted. This is very sturdy and fits on my fridge shelf perfectly.,20
positive,"The filter fits more snugly than paper filters, but it works fine; there is no leakage.",20
positive,Perfect Fit/Easily Installed!,20
negative,Basket completely detached from handle/rim.,20
positive,"The Samsung stove/range nob cracked, so I got these replacements.  These nobs are dimensionally the same.  I can't tell the difference.  The only noticeable difference is the font of the words are slightly different, but not enough for me to care.  I just put the replacement nob in the center range.  The other plus is that these are beefier in the area where it had cracked earlier.  So i expect these to last for quite a while.  If not I got 3 extras.",20
positive,"Ordered as an alternative to original Kenmore replacement part. Snapped in with minimum effort. Worked like original. I've only been running it a week but, it's doing the job.",20
positive,"Perfect fit to replace the lid I cracked.<br />Not the exact color, but it does the job.<br />Who cares!!",20
negative,Hope it works.  Lots of dents & scratches. Even had to straighten out the door hinges & feet.,20
positive,Great price and seems like a quality replacement. Very happy with purchase.,20
positive,LOVE this sloth dishwasher indicator!!! Already has had many compliments!,20
positive,"This was a bit pricey,  but was a perfect fit and nice and sturdy.",20
positive,Great value and exact fit for our refrigerator.  Will purchase again when we need more!  Received promptly!,20
positive,The description says this is a full size refrigerator but that is not the case in my opinion. The dimensions listed in the add are correct and this fridge was what I was expecting.  I am running out of space in my garage and wanted to replace the full size fridge I had in the garage with this. We‚Äôve been using it for the past 2 months and it has met our expectations.  Ours arrived in perfect condition and we are 100% satisfied.,20
positive,"Awesome, they work quite well.",20
positive,As listed. Nice high quality. Does not feel cheap or thin like some.,20
positive,Great price and easy install. Doesn‚Äôt block out everything that the high end name brands do. But bang for buck is good.,20
negative,I normally order this item and it lasts me for months . This was my first time ordering from this company and within a month my machine asking for it to be replaced . Be cautious there is a reason it‚Äôs less expensive,20
positive,"I am very picky about the things that I consume. I make cold brew coffee on a weekly schedule and much prefer it to hot brew. All of the coffee that i have used, both pre-ground and grinding at home, leaves a very fine powder in the coffee that creates a gritty feel to the beverage. This sifter does a much better job of removing these 'fines' than the K***e unit that I also have.<br />I would much appreciate a version of this sifter that had at least 2 and perhaps 8 times the capacity (I use 3 or 4 ounces, by weight, every time I  make cold brew and the time to sift that much coffee is unacceptable.",20
negative,"[[VIDEOID:1ecaf31cc9c46f0ef9e9046cdac15a0f]] It's really amazing how a company can produce such a flawed copy of such a simple part, but Supplying Demand has done it.<br />The door latch that comes in this kit is poorly manufactured. The tabs that are suppose to grab onto to housing flange and hold latch in place are not bent out enough. The latch easily slips out of the flange.<br />I tried to bend them out further and it broke. Supplying Demand sent me a replacement and it's exactly the same. DON'T waste your time on these.",20
positive,"Tends to over flow grounds into the coffee if you don't have the level JUST right. Otherwise, it's great for using non-Kcup coffee.",20
negative,Nice and flexible so it covers the gap well but the edges are not completely smooth all of the way which bothered me when I first saw it but decided to ignore it and keep it.,20
negative,RIP at 6 years.,20
negative,Seal is not very good.  causing ice to build up.,20
negative,"The thermal cut off was not as described. The description said it has a 352F cut off, but when it blew after a few minutes of drying I took it back out and realized it has a 309F cut off. Very dissapointed.",20
positive,Works great and cheap,20
negative,"Unfortunately, after only nine months, the label/writing is rubbing off around the temperature selectors.  Nothing abrasive was used--only dishwasher soap.  Very disappointing for this much money.  Will not purchase any GE products again.",20
positive,Quick and easy to use.,20
positive,Exactly what I was looking for,20
positive,I bought this for my son for Christmas who does not have a frig with an ice maker and was tired of ice trays taking up room in his freezer.  It is the neatest thing.  It really works.  He loves it.,20
positive,"These are great quality and quite durable.<br />Easy to clean and good for countless uses.<br />The fine gold filter will stand up to any coffee grind, but liked the box says, the finer the better.<br />This is also the best way to have your favorite (non-covered) coffee from a Keurig, or if your office doesn't carry your brand.<br />There's no waste with this and your ground can easily be dumped into compost or whatever.",20
positive,No problems.  Works great.,20
positive,Fit our microwave nicely and replaced our broken OEM one<br />It is as pictured,20
negative,"I bought this and it stopped working about 2 months after purchasing it. I attempted to return however I found it difficult to communicate with the vendor. I have not been able to get help with repair, replacement or refund. Waste of money. Do not buy",20
negative,died after 1 year and 10 months.  No warranty past 1 year.  I will look closer at warranties from now on.  No more Kitchen Aid in this kitchen- they have really gone downhill.,20
positive,Great machine. I bought it to wash my newborn baby‚Äôs clothes and so far i love it!!,20
positive,"Love this!  No more filling icecube trays!<br />The down side is that it doesn't keep the ice frozen. Ice is very soft and wet, so that when you put it into the freezer it all sticks together.",20
negative,"this was a replacement , for the one that came broken. this one stop working after 6 week. to bad for me,so be careful buying this unit",20
negative,Didn't fit my fridge even though it said it would. Numbers matched and everything. You win some you lose some I guess,20
positive,"Liked the price, quality and fast delivery.",20
positive,Easy to replace old part. Very strong and durable.,20
positive,"I really like these reusable Keurig pods. I have an old Keurig so they fit no problem. I do like also how this brand has the mesh underneath on the bottom. A lot of the other companies do not have that. Love the pack of four, it‚Äôs a great price, I definitely recommend!",20
positive,Hose works as advertised. Great addition to vacuum cleaner hose to clean dryer vents as well as other hard to reach places. Universal attachment.,20
positive,works and fit perfectly,20
positive,"Simple and cost-effective solution to the problem of securing the dishwasher to a granite countertop. I didn't expect much when I ordered it but was pleasantly surprised that the bracket is MUCH sturdier than I thought. Overall there are no frills to it, it just does the job.",20
negative,"I purchased this filter on March 8,18 and it stopped filtration of water on my fridge, which caused me to have to buy another one on April 25, 18. This product did not last the 6 months as advertised.",20
positive,"It works great, we all chipped in at work to buy it. So far it's working great, it does some weird sounds sometimes. But we have our fingers crossed that it will last.",20
positive,Works great.,20
positive,Works as expected.,20
negative,"It doesn't make good coffee. I've tried packing the coffee grounds more and less and not at all, I've tried different coarseness of grind, and I've tried different amounts of water. Nothing will make this thing produce good coffee. It is always just dirty looking water coming out with little flavor. This pod also causes an error on my nespesso machine about every third time I try it, and the machine has a hard time ejecting the pod about half the time. The machine makes great coffee with the original single use pods, and i was hoping to have a reusable pod that I could add my own grounds too. This product doesn't produce satisfactory results for me.",20
negative,Wasnt easy to install but great for saving money not having to buy bottle waters all the time taste clean like bottle waters,20
positive,As someone who spends a lot of time outdoors I needed a product to replace my french press so I didn‚Äôt have to lug that around on every trip. I‚Äôve used this twice so far to test it out before going outdoors with it and I‚Äôm very pleased with it. It is very easy to use and clean. The coffee turned out turned out great!,20
positive,"Yes, it is a bulb for an oven so it is different but that price is too high. It illuminates well. The old bulb had been out for a while so it is nice to see what is going on in the oven.",20
positive,So I did have an issue with the unit it did leak some water so I contacted the seller several times and unfortunately he does not respond at all so you're really on your own with this unit. It turns out what I think happened is it might have overfilled however everything else is really good on it it's quality machine it works well it washes well but don't expect a response from the seller should you have a problem!!,20
positive,The filter fits my refrigerator and works great. Easy to install and the product came quickly.  I am Very happy!!,20

negative,I would not recommend getting this machine. When it is making ice it is extremely loud and runs for several hours.<br /><br />Wish I never bought this machine- save your money,20
negative,"This screen is smaller than the original, leaving a quite noticeable gap at the bottom edge (noticed while lint screen housing assembly was removed during service). This gap will allow lint to easily bypass the screen and possibly cause issues (clogged dryer vent, etc...). I will be ordering an oem lint screen as soon as possible.",20
positive,Muy buenos,20
positive,"I've used these for several years now (see below notes on how they have ""finally gotten it right"").  This review amendment is to detail how to USE them really, really fast ... without bothering with a special ""holder"" and a ""brush"" - both of which I myself tried to invent when I first started using MyCaps..<br /><br />.......................... USING MyCaps Efficiently ...........................................<br /><br />1 - hold a cup in hand and overfill with spoonful of grounds<br />2 - gently tap edges of rim to perfectly clear over-fill so rim is clean<br />3 - set cup aside and fill as many more as needed<br />4 - position foil atop cup, gently pressing foil across width of cup<br />5 - gently press across perpendicularly to first gentle press and adjust so foil is even all around<br /><br />NOTE: you will NEVER get perfect covering (I've tried and tried and tried)<br /><br />6 - with cup on counter still ... gently press MyCap foil to secure it across the cup on just one spot L and R ... then turn cup 90 degrees and gently press the other 2 sides on just one spot L & R<br />7 - with cup in one hand fold, over the rest of foil - NO NEED to press hard!<br />8 - firmly in one hand, score the foil firmly around the entire rim of the cup using FINGER NAIL.<br /><br />The last step is the most important and the ONLY thing you really need to worry about doing firmly since that is what makes an air-tight seal.<br /><br />The result may look a little sloppy (I never bother to press under the edge at all). But as long as you have scored around the edge completely you are good!<br /><br />...............................................................<br /><br />The new version of My-Cap makes refilling so easy. Used to be there were 2 serious problems:<br /><br />- the foil was too large. folding it over evenly every time was about impossible (I tried hundreds of times!). if not folded correctly, the crimped-under foil sometimes obscured part of the barcode and the pod would simply fail to work at all. VERY annoying!<br /><br />- foil sometimes would not peel off. so they added a tab and the problem goes away entirely. actually I did figure out how to peel before the tab was added but it was tricky. at one point I simply threw out a batch off foils since they were stuck to waxed paper so tightly  - could not peel off until I figured out how to ""massage"" the foil/waxed paper so as to get a fingernail hold and peel.<br /><br />Now BOTH problems have been addressed and the My-Caps work every time!<br /><br />Bravo, My-Cap company.",20
positive,"We have a very large family, and a 6 month filter for us only last 45-60, these filters were a true blessing, a fraction of the cost, and the water tastes so much better, score for us because we are on well water and any positive to the taste we are taking it!!! Will be buying all future filters from here!!",20
negative,"Like others have commented, I do not think this is worth the $50. I purchased the one that fit my gas range but it still shifts and allows food to drip onto the stove top. The material is very thin and slippery (slides around on the stove top). I would not purchase again.",20
positive,Good price. Saved a lot of money over buying them in the store. Did what they are supposed to do. Would purchase again when needed.,20
positive,The most wonderful coffee I‚Äôve ever tasted coming from this little press.<br /> Nothing compares to the quality of coffee you get from this machine.<br />Absolutely wonderful I will never drink coffee from any other machine after drinking from the aeropress.,20
positive,"We've been using the K cups with coffee already in them.  Although we've been purchasing off brand coffee K cups the coffee seemed bitter and we didn't know what the package the coffee was in contained, toxins, etc.  This stainless steel container is sturdy and you can put as much coffee as you want according to its size.  I prefer a little less coffee.  It's easily cleaned.  You do have to wait until it cools before the next person uses it.  I highly recommend this product.  My mom even purchased one after I told her about it.  All in all,  I think that you'll save money using this product.",20
positive,These work perfectly. They look like the ones I had for my original keurig but some slight modifications make them work in my 2.0. And they are pink.,20
positive,I always use the disposable drip pan liner so that my stove burners look clean. They fit good.,20
positive,Great product great service,20
positive,Very easy to install,20

positive,It went together securely,20
positive,"Much more affordable filter for our LG French door fridge. Took a bit to install, but that is more the design of our fridge than the filter. Good value.",20

positive,Purchased to replace the cracked foot bin. Seems sturdy and great replacement part.,20
negative,They were a great price but too tall for my father‚Äôs humidifier machine. I had to cut off approx. 1/4‚Äù so the cover would fit.,20
negative,"This product worked for a month but then the screw either popped out or broke and now the wheel does not stay in the track.  This dishwasher has been very frustrating.  The first 2 times this part broke, we bought a much cheaper part.  Those broke after about a month each time we replaced it.  After that part broke 2 times, we decided to buy this more expensive replacement part.  Unfortunately, this part broke after only a month.  In addition, the other 3 screws are completely rusted for the other wheels.",20
negative,"Showed up broken in a smashed box with no padding or packing around it in the box. Box was about three times bigger than the part. Only a small piece of webbing was broke out, so we decided to gamble and keep it rather than deal with the return process. Otherwise it is an exact fit and fits our Kenmore refrigerator perfectly.",20
positive,Arrived on time.  Good product for the price.  These smaller 4 cup filters are sometimes hard to find in stores.  Our coffee make had their small basket so the big ones don‚Äôt work.  These Junior Filters are exactly what we needed.<br /><br />Note: These are ‚ÄúJunior‚Äù filters for the smaller basket coffee makers.  They are Melitta brand although the picture online did not show the bag.,20
positive,Delivered and received as ordered.  Product installed perfectly and worked great.  Our water actually tastes much better.  Will definitely reorder from here again.,20
negative,"I go through a lot of ice. I live in an apt. so buying the ice maker attachment for my frig is out.<br /><br />This is okay but it took up too much counter space to keep out all of the time.  Plus it is heavy so once you put it down, you want to leave it down.<br /><br />If you have the option of putting an ice maker in your frig, that is the better choice.",20

positive,"Great filters! These are very nice quality, and the water tastes very pure. Thank you for making these!",20
negative,"Defective. After three weeks, it locked up and started causing a loud rattle in the refrigerator. This is the second time I've had this issue with this particular brand, and the return period ended too quickly for me to return it. Bad product, bad return policy.",20
positive,Nothing to dislike. Several people in the office uses the ice. Not sure how I ever got along without it.,20

positive,Cheaper and fast!,20
positive,"We've got a Cuisinart coffee maker and  many of the filters we've bought in local stores never fit properly.  These filters on the other hand are just the ticket! Price is reasonable and the filters fit, what more can you ask?",20

positive,"I use this for my Brazilian Rosewood Orchestra Model guitar. It is easy to set up, provides very accurate temperature and humidity readings (I tested it with a room humidistat before using it) and provides me great comfort that I will know if there is an issue with my precious guitar. I like it better than the D'Addario Humiditrak",20
negative,Very convenient and easy to use. But after only 3 uses the seam is starting to come apart!! I will soon have to throw away bc grounds will start to go through,20

negative,Soaked as directed.,20
positive,item works great. arrived in timely manner,20
positive,"So glad they made both sizes of these. The carafe size is awesome for making pots but since Im the only one who drinks coffee in my house this size is extremely convenient. I love that I get to use freshly ground coffee every morning. Plus it saves a penny to say the least. But on top of this awesome filter find, di Oro has THE NICEST customer service I've ever experienced at Amazon. Normally it takes me going through a series of automated systems, being put on hold, or getting voice mailboxes, but with di Oro, it took one phone call, and I got to speak directly with a di Oro servicer. He was soooo nice, and he corrected the shipping mistake I had without a second thought. And he did that exact second. Never have I ever had such amazing customer service. Such a breath of fresh air!! Thank you di Oro!",20
positive,Very nice and convenient for my bf and I do laundry in our apartment (: very easy to use as well.,20
negative,Absolutely worst ! Stopped working the day after return eligible ü§¨. Compressor went out on day 32. Buy different brand and save yourself a boat load of money and time from lost food and it will cost more to have it fixed then what it cost for original purchase.,20
positive,It was the correct replacement for my Keurig,20
positive,Love these!! Only wish purchased them sooner !!,20
positive,Inexpensive,20
positive,Great value & very easy to install. Would definitely purchase again.,20
positive,I do love this design. It makes it easy for me to vent my dryer BUT the filters are the horrible. They should be designed in a way they can be washed and reused. After cleaning them 3-4 times it is already falling apart. I am going to look for other options such as a washable air conditioning filter I can cut to fit.,20
negative,"Really floppy, they don't really stay put on the counter. I'll probably just toss them.",20
positive,A perfect fit and replacement for an old greasy filter,20
positive,I love these. Really helped with my kitchen remodel!,20
negative,"We bought a house that was five years old and came with the refrigerator.  There was no way to tell if the filter had been changed recently or ever so I purchased a HM Digital TDS-3 Handheld TDS Meter With Carrying Case, 0 - 9990 ppm TDS Measurement Range, 1 ppm Resolution, +/- 2% Readout Accuracy  from Amazon.  I took the reading of the filtered refrigerator water, the tap at kitchen sink, the bathroom faucet and bottled water.  The refrigerator, the kitchen, & the bathroom all read 157 ppm and the bottled water reading was 30 ppm, so this told me I needed to replace the filter.<br /><br />I ordered this filter when it arrived I installed it and ran the refrigerator water dispenser the 3 mins per instructions plus an additional 3 mins. I took the first reading and it was at 776 ppm!!  I ran the water an additional 5 mins and it dropped to 237 ppm. A week later it registers 172 ppm, so I call Frigidaire to find out if there is an explanation to which they had none and told me that maybe a got a bad one and that I should contact Amazon for and exchange, which I did and as always Amazon was very helpful and sent me a  replacement.  The new one...... it started out with a 227 reading it is now (after being installed 8 days) reading 146 ppm with my tap at 158 ppm.<br /><br />Why am I buying a filter that does not filter????  I don't know if I should try getting another one or not, or am I getting filters that have been returned?  I say that because they have not been in a sealed wrap.... they have had little plastic caps on the ends that can be pulled off and put back on with out detection of it being used, I even replaced the new caps on the used filter I was returning in case left over water was to leak out, so it looked just like the replacement one....so maybe that could be happening.  I don't know but I feel I have been duped and wish someone could supply an explanation.",20
positive,Purchased this replacement part at a fraction of the cost of the brand name replacement part.  My husband installed it and it is working really well.,20
negative,"You might be thinking using a washer and dryer cover will keep them looking nice, but it also leads to hidden mold and mildew build up.<br /><br />I have one of those new fangled washing machines that weighs the clothes beforehand in order  to dispense the least amount of water in order to launder them.<br /><br />This has save me a fortune on my water bill, but it also means water remains inside the bottom of the tub even while not in use. Need to keep the washing machine door open in order to allow fresh air to flow through the inner drum. This not only reduces the chance of mold growing inside my washing machine but keeps it always smelling fresh.<br /><br />Placing a thick cover over it will lead to mold growth, foul odors and probably create a nice dark space for creepy crawlies to occupy. The dryer has an exhaust tube attach in the back. This channels hot air outside, while also allowing fresh air to circulate inside. Will be safe to keep covered for long periods of time. A washer doesn't have that same luxury.<br /><br />Now if you need something to protect your washer, dryer, mini fridge from damage while transporting or remodeling, these anti-slip cotton blend covers are perfect.",20

positive,Same as original at 10% of the price.,20

positive,"I have only had this ice machine a few days, however,  I am super impressed how quietly it runs, love it",20
positive,Was skeptical when ordering these filters for my new Keurig 2... not any more.  It's amazing how these filters are so compatible with the scanning system that Keurig uses - I really like them.  There are no problems with the coffee apparatus not recognizing these beauties.  I wonder how they did this?,20

My only problem with it is, as another reviewer mentioned, there are poky edges. I am a bit worried that my clothes are going to snag on it and be ruined, but so far so good (I think...the only things that have gotten holes recently are things that are pretty old and would've likely gotten holes in any washer/dryer combo.)",20

I bought it mainly for the storage and the humidity control is just the bonus.  The item came well-packed, no damage or whatsoever.  Given Prime shipping, the quality of packaging/shipping may have improved.<br /><br />The cabinet is lightweight, which is a plus but the storage space runs a bit smaller than what I thought.  I kept the for foam for the first two drawers.  In the middle drawer, I kept my canon 70-200 mm and 100-400 mm,  there is only room for one more telephoto lens.  As for the top, the foam is in groove.  I lay my lenses flat, but the grooves were thin, doesnt fit 85 mm F1.2 well, even 16-35 mm is a bit thick for it.  I guess one could remove the foam and lay the lenses upright.  So, I manage to fit 16-35 mm, 35 mm, 50 mm, 85 mm and 100 mm macro.  Have room for two more shorter, more skinny lenses.

positive,"It wasn't my choice to have Bosch appliances - the builder outfitted the place with Bosch. And I am not happy with nearly all the Bosch appliances. The refrigerator in question model # is B22CS30...<br /><br />Obviously, fridge makers are making BIG bucks selling proprietary water filters that are basically made of the most prolific thing on earth - carbon. Obscenely priced filters. I've tried a bunch of supposedly compatible Bosch filters over the last few years with very disappointing results - until this one, all of them have either not fit at all, or have leaked or had serious issues. This is the first one that actually works in my Bosch counter-depth sidexside fridge.<br /><br />I'm not too thrilled with the company/brand, though. They don't disclose where the filter is made. The literature seems to indicate it is ""self-certified"".  The paperwork that comes with the filter attempts to scare you into changing every six months, warning the filter could burst causing extensive leakage/damage. (I've kept a Bosch Ultraclarity in the fridge for more than 1.5 years without issue.)<br /><br />Research indicates this ""Best Choice"" brand is actually a company called Space Flex International LLC, with HQ in Rancho Cucamonga, NV. And Whirpool Corp sued Space Flex for patent infrigement. And Space Flex also has trademarked some other water filter brands.<br /><br />There are copycats of the ""real"" Ultraclarity filter - it's just a mess. We'd be better off without any water filters for refrigerators and if you want one, put a standalone whole home or external filter. So, when I look for replacement fridge, hope to find something better than this.",20

Follow the instructions on priming the unit to clear the micro activated charcoal particles.  Other than the long priming the unit is a good value.  The unit needs to be replaced every 6 months.,20

Still, it did what I needed it to do (in our case, redirect the air upwards from an oddly-placed wall vent a foot off the floor behind where we moved our couch).

positive,"Got these filters after ordering the OEM LG ones from a third party seller and receiving what I thought were counterfeit ones.  These amazon ones are definitely not counterfeit, filter to NSF 42, 53, and 401 (I even checked on the NSF website). The OEM filters only meet NSF 42 and 53 not 410, so the premium amazon ones actually filter more.  They installed easily, the water tastes great, the ice has no smell, and there much cheaper.  I'm going to get these from now on especially since I can't trust all the random sellers who sell discount ones because they might be fake.",20
positive,Easy to install and and does a great job,20
positive,"The vent works very well. I installed one at our last house after a chipmunk entered our dryer vent from a flapper type vent; we've never had an issue since then.<br />I installed one of these about 10 years ago at our present house, and it lasted until I hit it with a snow shovel and it shattered. I installed this new one and it fits up to the old holes exactly. It holds up pretty well, but the material is fairly brittle and you need to be gentle when tightening up the mounting screws.",20

positive,18 months ago I paid an appliance repairman to replace this fuse. He charged me $18 for the fuse and the total bill was $175 for showing up and installation. So I got 2 fuses for $6 and put it in myself in about half an hour. Piece of cake. Just watched Youtube to see how to do it.,20

negative,"The two ovens are both usable. The wide coursing of the heating elements produced uniform heat in both, even when placing a baking sheet on the bottom rack position. But for this price, you darn well should get a few extra inches of heating rod. That said, the fancy extra features have turned me off. 1) The control buttons. There is an array of 9 and an array of four buttons for the upper oven on the left, and a symmetrical array of 4 and 9 for the lower oven on the right. The arrays of 4 are identical; that's good. But in the larger 9-button arrays, only the warm button is in the same place on the two arrays. The buttons you will typically use (bake button, oven light button, broil, etc) are in different places on the two arrays, and so even once you are familiar with the oven, you will be hunting and pecking. 2) The manual. It reads like a computer software manual (""for the pizza feature, select the pizza button""). It does not explain why you would want to select a ""pizza feature"" instead of just using ""bake"". Is it hotter? - No, the max temp is still 550F. What's the difference between the separate settings for fresh pizza or frozen? The manual says that ""1"" is for fresh, ""2"" is for frozen. Well, that certainly explains it to full intellectual satisfaction. Moving on to the slow cook settings; neither the manual nor the oven display reveals the temperature, but you are asked to select among four types of food and two heat levels. I used a calibrated oven and a long temperature probe to measure the temperature of 4 quarts of water, heating in a 5.5 qt ceramic slow-cook covered pot. When set to ""stew"" and ""Lo"" and ""7 hr cook time"", the water reached 202F by 2 hrs, full simmer of 207F at 2.5 hr, 203 F at 3 hrs, and then dropped slowly, dropping below 200F by 3.5 hr. I don't know of a cook , hoping to retain nutrients and proper food texture by a low temp slow-cooking method, who would choose to nearly boil the stew for over an hour. Using 2 quarts caused hours of frank boiling. When I tried the ""beef"" and ""Hi"" setting on 4 quarts of water, it reached 209F by 2 hr and dropped to 200F only by 3.5 hr. Any beef would be cardboard texture by then. Moving on to the ""roast convection"", this has nothing to do with roasting (which involves an oiled food in a uniform very hot oven). Instead, the top heating element comes on, which if not used very briefly, will char the topmost part of your otherwise evenly browned food. It is best used when one wants a broiled effect, but desires to keep the door closed. As long as GE won't engage the consumer by providing a mechanistic explanation of its dozens of settings, I would plan on using the ovens only in broil, bake, and convection modes.",20

negative,"Although the My K-Cup is a solution to using your own coffee grounds, there is a better & less expensive option out there.  I found the My Kap ([...]) to be a much better alternative because you can reuse your old K-cups.  Where the bulky My K-Cup requires you to remove the Keurig's K-Cup inner assembly and also allows the water to flow freely from all sides of the filter, the My-Kap simply snaps onto an old cup, allowing you to reuse your K-Cups several times, and only allowing the water to flow through the bottom pinhole.  Also, you cannot store the My K-Cup in your carousel (if you have one), whereas the My-Kap allows you to by reusing your old cups.  Lastly, at two My-Kaps for $10, it's a slightly more economical choice than the My K-Cup.  I bought mine a week ago and couldn't be happier.",20

positive,"[[VIDEOID:deec960e4b115058809e5c77d8369653]] After having twins, I was on double dad duty--washing 2x the bottles (Dr Browns bottles nonetheless), 2x the pacifiers, couple sets of breast pump parts.  I'm in no position to complain.  After all, my wife did carry them in her tummy for 9 months, but nonetheless, I do go about life with the principle of working smarter and not harder.  Therefore, I purchased this little gem with the sole intent of keeping it upstairs on the master bathroom counter for washing baby stuff. I could run all the parts downstairs and use the dish washer in the kitchen but that violates the principle of working smarter.<br /><br />I use 7th Gen non-toxic dishwasher gel on the ""speed"" (26 min) setting and everything I wash comes out squeaky clean.  I do give everything a quick rinse in the sink beforehand, simply because I may not run the load right away and may sit a few hours.<br /><br />The washed items come out squeaky clean but the drying cycle leaves a lot to be desired.  It's maybe a ""sort of dry"" at best for the items that I'm washing, but I am willing to bet that dishes and plates would come out mostly dry. The fact that it does have a heated dry feature is pretty cool though.<br /><br />Couple things though:<br />1. I'm not a huge fan of the blue light. It screams Made in China-although the build quality of this thing is pretty darn good.<br /><br />2. It's a bit louder than I thought it'd be. I don't know if it's actually the advertised 50 db but I feel it's louder.<br /><br />3. My biggest gripe is the water filling hole.  There's a built in filter near the top that causes the water to splash out. To avoid this, I have to fill my pitchers half way and therefore I have to fill the machine with 6 half pitchers instead of 3 full pitchers. Not a deal breaker. It did come with a filler hose but I am not able to attach it to my bathroom faucet.  I can probably remedy this by 3D printing a wide mouth funnel.",20

I created a laundry space from an old bathtub area.  Very tight fit for a washer and dryer.  When the delivery guy saw where the appliances were going he just groaned about having to connect the dryer first and then lift the washer in place.  I showed him the MagVent and he said it looked interesting.  Then he installed the washer, and clamped the MagVent to the dryer and pushed it back.  We both heard the click when the magnet connected.  He said these should be standard equipment on all dryers.  After serval hours of use I can report no leakage in the laundry area.  FANTASTIC product.",20

I was currently using a dish rag to catch any drippings of water/ice from the refrigerator and that was not working out well.  I had to change the rag and replace it often, because it would get wet and become useless for cleaning up any further drippings.  I chose the rectangular sized drip catchers which come 4 to a pack and they fit perfectly.  I didn't need to cut them at all to fit, but that is an option if you need to do that.  I have included a photo and a video to show the incredible absorbency of these drip catchers.  When water lands on the catcher it is quickly absorbed, leaving no wetness behind or beneath the catcher.  They are easy to maintain, hand wash and replace.  Overall, a fantastic, practical product that works!  AAA+++",20
positive,Very easy to install. It keeps the kids out of the snack fridge.

negative,"I didn‚Äôt twice the price of other generic filters to buy the one my Kitchen Aid fridge recommends that is supposed to filter out the most pollutants. My fridge is the French door stole. If has an ice dispenser but no water dispenser so I bought they strictly for ice made from filtered water. I don‚Äôt know if the fact that my fridge has no water dispenser to flush the system between changing filters, but upon changing a very old filter that made normal looking ice, I installed this and the first patch of ice was GRAY. I‚Äôd never seen gray ice in my life. So I had to throw all the mew ice out from the first patch with new filter which left me two days with no ice. The second batch is only partially made but it looks okay. I‚Äôm just very on the fence about the effectiveness of this product that would produce gray ice upon first using (considering the old expired filter made normal looking ice.) What is in this product that ir makes gray ice?!!",20
positive,"***Please read my update on this product at the end of my review concerning lighting the burners.  The burner lighting process is no longer much of an issue for me.  Also, please shop around for prices on this cooktop.  I got it locally for the same price or less than many on-line sites.<br /><br />I love the looks and how it cooks.  However, I absolutely HATE the way the burners light; they take forever to light.  The salesman told me they take about 3-5 seconds to light.  However, mine take at least 20 seconds to light, and I have to keep trying and trying.  The only burner that lights well is the center burner, and that is the one I use the least.  We have an appointment for a serviceman to come out and check the burners next week.  Hopefully, he can fix them, because it puts me in a bad mood every time I use the cooktop.<br /><br />The other thing that bothers me is that the two most useful size burners are in the back, with a larger burner and a very small burner being in the front. This makes cooking more difficult.<br /><br />Finally, this stainless steel cooktop scratches REALLY easily.  I have tried to be extremely careful, and still get scratches.<br /><br />I was so excited to get this cooktop and wanted  to love it.  Now, I regret buying it.<br /><br />***UPDATE:  I wanted to update my review.  We had a technician come out today to check the burner ignition system, and I think my is solved. He did adjust a burner for me, but I don't think that was my problem. I believe I wasn't pushing the burner knobs all the way down when I was trying to light the burners.  It felt like I was, but I evidently wasn't.  They seem to light fine now after holding them down for about 3 to 5 seconds.  I still don't like the fact that you have to hold them down at all, but that is just the way the ignition system is on this cooktop.  It is a safety feature, and the technician said a lot of brands are making some of their models like this now.  Oh, and make sure you turn the knob to the picture of the flame and not the picture of the spark when you light the burners. I am changing my review to four stars, instead of three ...I am still not happy with how easily the stainless scratches or the arrangement of the burner sizes on the cooktop.",20

This could be the oven design...Kenmore model 790.31043800<br /><br />Here's an important tip. If you can't get the door clamp to lock both hinges together (small clamp that you pull towards the door) then use a pair of thin vice grips on both sides to keep the hinge together otherwise the door will never come out if there's still tension on the spring.  Be careful not to damage the sides and have a helper assist with other side. You can do one at a time if you have a helper hold the other side of the door with little movement so you don't damage the hinge input area within the interior of the oven.<br /><br />Product quality looks solid and fixed my issue of the oven door slightly being open and food taking longer to cook.  I'm hoping they last for years as this oven is about 10 years old and it's the 1st time replacing these (they've been bad for a couple of years)....I'll update in 6 or 12 months.<br /><br />I'm glad these were available and the seller was great at communicating and shipping was fast despite being USPS which, has notoriously been delivering items late.<br /><br />I'd definitely buy again if needed.",20

positive,Water Filters for my Brita,20
negative,I bought this filter 12 months ago. I got 2 filters for less than I paid for 1. I hit repurchase from my old order and I blinded and ripped off. I will look elsewhere next time.  Very unfair!,20
positive,Size,20
positive,Good replacement filter. Good price.,20
positive,"I love this dual fuel range. I cook, bake, and can. This range is everything and then some.<br />Tip: don't leave racks in for self cleaning.<br />Top oven is great for cheesy potatoes or dinner rolls when making big holiday meals!",20
positive,This was awesome I really liked it it fit thank you,20
positive,Easy to use!  Definitely something that should be included in reusable keurig pods!,20
positive,"I have a KUDS35FXSS. I removed the old gasket, and then installed this new one. The instillation was pretty simple. Biggest issue I had was that the corners were a bit tough. I ended up using a heat gun to heat up the product some, and also a blunt screw driver to push in the gasket. Just ran the first wash, and there were no leaks.",20
positive,My dryer needed a four-pronged cord after my old and terrible landlord switched the orignal out for a 3 pronged at our last residence...he didn't leave our original cord which was highly irritaiting and so this fit the dryer and at a MUCH CHEAPER cost than buying it in town at the hardware stores.,20
positive,K cup coffee filters worked in my classic Keuig arrived on time and good product,20
positive,"fast shipping , good item , would buy again",20
positive,Fixed the dryer perfectly.,20
positive,This machine works very well. It does what it says. I would recommend watching videos and doing your research on this product. It's worth the money for sure if you are wondering if you should the answer is yes:),20
positive,Perfect pod worked as expected on our keurig 2.0. Nice to be able to make carafe of our favorite coffee.,20
positive,Love the value. If you buy one filter retail...$49.99! This will save you some serious cash.,20
positive,Great,20
positive,Bought this as a gift for my parents. It works great. The ice cubes are small so they fit in bottles as well.,20
positive,"Awesome! It works very good, just wish they would make a larger one for the carafe. I will be watching for that.",20
positive,Helps!,20
positive,"Quick and easy review: this works well, but you need to be careful so you don't puncture your dryer piping.",20
negative,These things are ok. They are very thin and get very wrinkly when bent.  They are also made of vinyl not rubber or silicone which is what my impression was.  They are easy to cut though.,20
negative,This mesh filter does not work as well as the paper filters. It allows too much liquid to follow through before pressing.,20
positive,Perfect,20
negative,"As other reviewers stated, the small drip pans fit my stove and the large did not. I knew it was chancy but, after research got me no answers, ordered this anyway. The large pan was too big by about 1/8&#34; or more. My solution was that I took it with me to a Sears store and looked for a large pan that was slightly smaller. What I got was a GE PartsMaster 8&#34; drip bowl, PM32113. It fits perfectly and the label states &#34; fits most brands EXCEPT GE and Hotpoint.&#34; So I have to assume that if you have those brands, it would be a good idea to check out this set. I also found that the GE product is a little bit thicker metal than these, which doesn't bother me but it's good to know there is a difference in optional quality. Now my real challenge will be keeping these clean! The old ones came with the house we bought.",20
negative,"This advertised to work with my Whirlpool washer's model number.<br />It came, the plug isn't compatible with my washer, instead of returned, I cut and reused my old one to make it work.<br />Not happy about it.",20

positive,These coffee filters work well and are inexpensive. What's not to like.,20
positive,"Recently remodeled my kitchen and i wanted something to prevent stuff from dripping in between my stovetop and the lower cabinets.  These things work great, easy to clean and i dont have to worry about grease bleeding down the side of my appliance",20
negative,First filter only lasted 1 week,20
positive,"These parts are exactly what they say they in the discription. Also the customer service is top notch. If installed correctly they should give excellent life. I removed the weights from my drum and it made it a lot easier to handle. Only 4-bolts per weight. A couple of the flat nuts fell out, this could have made installing the lower weight a problem, but I just taped them in place, then removed the tape once installed. The only thing that went wrong with the job was the small plastic boss that holds the hose on the soap despenser sheared off. I used a radiator clamp over the existing latch arm and it is stronger than before.",20
positive,They work perfectly.,20
positive,"Great taste,simple use ,easy to clean",20
positive,"I love these things.  They make your Keurig so much less expensive and less wasteful to use.  For a while, I was using K-cups that were designed so that the plastic part of the cups was recyclable, but separating the cup from the coffee pod was tricky and I was still generating a lot of waste, even though it was going in the recycling bin instead of the trash.  Now I just add my ground coffee to this re-useable cup (which takes about 10 seconds), pop it in, push the button and wait for my coffee to brew.  The coffee grounds get dumped in the compost bin (they are a GREAT source of nitrogen) and the cup gets rinsed out and its ready for re-use.  Super easy and way less wasteful than the k-cups.",20
negative,I was really hoping this would be a high quality product. But alas I was mistaken. The interior had a chipping / flaking seam across the entire base.<br />I'd be willing to pay more for thicker steel and better quality. Companies just need to make the stuff.,20

positive,Worked great,20
positive,Very easy to install.  Great product!,20
positive,"Price was right, just got a new carpet and wanted to start with new parts for my Shark",20

positive,"Exactly what I needed after melting mine in the bottom of my dishwasher. Good price, perfect fit.",20
positive,"Bought this for my daughter because her brother was always sneaking into her mini fridge taking her goodies when he has his own lol, great little lock for the money & serves it‚Äôs purpose!!",20
negative,I did not really enjoy using them. I used the best ground coffee but the espresso that I take is not satisfying. Also I feel like my Nespresso machine is Kinda damaged the water does not pass properly anymore. I should mention that these pods always get stuck in machine after using them.,20
positive,"After my dryer quit working I ordered a pair of these on a whim after reading about how dryers work (turns out they are pretty darn simple if you stop and look at all the parts involved).<br /><br />If your dryer quit working, chances are one of these parts is to blame. Since buying this I've now fixed 4 different dryers (not using this same exact part mind you). You'll use the large piece and ONE of the smaller pieces depending on if you have a gas or electric powered dryer.",20
positive,Replaced the bellow seal for my Whirlpool front loading washer and it is good as new. Very pleased with my purchase. I was able to watch a you tube video of the install and my husband and I installed it in 45 minutes.,20
positive,I wish I would have purchased this metal filter sooner. No more paper filters.  I have taken my aeropress with this filter on a cruise. It was great to have my own preferred coffee with me.,20
positive,Prevent spilled foods.  Helpful but still you have to scrub and wash it good.,20
positive,I bought this for additional sound proofing for a new Frigidaire dishwasher. It definitely helps with noise reduction.,20
positive,A good buy and works great in my coffee maker. A lot cheaper here than purchasing through Cuisinart.,20
positive,I loved these filters for my Samsung refrigerator and they cost a lot less than name brand. They do the job just fine!,20
positive,"Take out the old one, put in the new one, and by the magic of technology, you have once again mastered fire. Do be attentive and use only the included wire nuts- they're ceramic, and if you use standard electrical wire nuts, I suspect you'd get an interesting sort of electrical fire, or at least an amazing new flavor in your stove.",20
positive,This is perfect for our outdoor kitchen. It works great and is beautiful.,20
positive,"Good product,  good quality and easy to install",20
positive,Love this sealer. It‚Äôs affordable and works really well. Easy to use. Great for sealing Mylar bags and other goodies,20
positive,as promised,20
positive,"Water taste is great.<br />We are going to purchase it again<br />It runs quietly...I say this because<br />We previously purchased:<br /> Maytag UKF8001 Pur Compatible Refrigerator Water Filter by MORE Pure Filters - MPF15090<br />and found that though the water tasted fine & we followed the install instructions ( & even took it out & re installed it) that it caused our fridge water dispenser to be obnoxiously loud. Figured it was air in the system & would work it's way out. 6 months later , right before it was time to replace the filter, it suddenly became a quiet running system. ??? we use our fridge water a good bit...so not sure what was with that, but we decided to try another water filter & are glad we did",20
positive,Awesome price.,20
positive,Little taller then what was original but worked just as well,20
positive,Works great for my washer. Model-eimed60lss2 ....... washer kept alarming out 10 min into the wash and sounded like a space ship. Fixed the alarm but i still have a bit of sound and i think thats the roller bearings im replacing next... the hardest part for me was getting the hub off my washer. If you have the sme model you may have trouble like me.. i watched vids on how to replace but nothing seemed to work... ended up grabbing a rachet strap and feeding it thru under the hub making it even across the middle and twist the strap to get a bit of grip on the hub and just give her a BIG tug or two...,20
positive,Fits my GE French door fridge perfectly.,20
positive,Excellent design and product.<br />Plugs and play now the ac compressor is running just fine.,20
negative,These cups often cause leaking when brewing and don‚Äôt get a good  flow of coffee like the regular k-cups. I‚Äôm not totally satisfied.,20
positive,"DIY! I saved over $200. Very easy to install and my oven warmed up perfectly. You save money doing it yourself. The call to the repairman is almost $100, plus parts and labor. I took the $20 risk and it came out successful.",20
positive,Wonderful hood that looks dramatic against my Jet Mist granite backsplash.  Fan works well but is not quiet.,20
positive,Perfect replacement to make my ice maker work again. very easy to replace.,20
positive,"Love it. No more spilled coffee! Very easy to use, you have to tap it lightly to get grounds going out, I'm glad I got it!",20
positive,I am so happy to have found this product. It works very well. You only have to use a little to clean the scum on the tub surface.,20
positive,"Ordered this sleek and stylish cooktop from another retailer. The first time I ordered it, there was one defective burner but was able to return and reorder. The second time was the charm for me. It is aesthetically appealing and have no complaints so far. Pleased with the purchase.",20
positive,Works great...no more paper filters to purchase. Exactly as advertised.  I recommend this product.,20
positive,"Cheap easy fix to my dryer,  try this first before buying a new one!",20
positive,I love how light and how easy it is to maneuver around. I've found the perfect little corner to put it and it gets my white work shirts super clean.,20
positive,The item came the next day. No more messy side cabinet or side stove,20
positive,Although the machine is a little loud when first turning it on but once it is up and running then quiets down quite a bit. Enjoy the ice it makes and is easy to keep a bag(s) in the freezer for future use. We use a gallon size ziplock bag when we empty the machine and come back 30 minutes later when it is frozen and break it up with very few big chunks which makes it easy to just poor out of the bag into our glasses.,20
negative,ITS KINDA LOUD BUT IT WAS A GREAT DEAL SO I WILL DEAL WITH IT. KEEPS THE BEER COLD BUT IMPARTS A PLASTIC ODOR TO THE CANS?  MUST BE A BREAK IN PERIOD OR SOMETHING,20
positive,This part is worth it! The generic part costs less. I bought it and it made a really loud noise so I decided to get the official part instead-was well worth it and completely worth it.,20
positive,Very nice. I had to replace my old one and thought this one was a good buy. Works good so far. A little difficult to install,20
negative,Cheap plastic that snaps/crumbles after a few washes. Save your money and find something else,20
positive,"This ice maker is everything we needed. Makes ice fast enough to stay ahead of 4 family members who use a lot of ice. The ice tastes good and easy to chew. Just remember it only makes ice it doesn‚Äôt keep it frozen, you have to dump the basket when it gets full. It‚Äôll fill a freezer drawer in a few hours, makes 9 cubes about every 8 minuets",20
positive,"DO NOT BUY OPAL NUGGET MACHINE. We had it for not even two years and it broke. The company didn‚Äôt want to help me fix it at all. Sent me a 20% off coupon to buy another. Why would I buy another if it‚Äôs not gonna last. Much less you not even point me in the direction to get it fixed. That was $500!!<br /><br />We bought this ice machine as a replacement and it‚Äôs faster, quieter, and just better overall. Also the nugget could never keep up with the ice when we had company over but this machine does! I am so happy with my switch. Well after 3 months it started to make a loud noise. I reached out to customer service and within 8 hours they responded and said they would send a replacement. I‚Äôm very pleased. Don‚Äôt hesitate this is the best ice!",20
positive,"Fits great inside a cigar humidor, and is easy to read.",20
positive,"These are exact size and work great. If only, metal ones were made!",20
positive,they came in 2 packs of 150.  they look fine.  they are a gift and I don't want to open the package. they were the best price.,20
positive,These are great and make our stove look so much nicer after replacing our old ones. As long as you know what your doing they are easy to install. One of them didn't fit correctly but it still fit good and you can't really tell.,20
negative,"So..  I am a fool and did not listen to the other reviews and figured I would chance it. As you can see in the picture, unit was bent in for shipping and I have noticed a hairline fissure/crack at bend point.  Not a biggie as my multimeter still shows decent resistance and good continuity.<br />That said, installed only to find that like others the nut size is different from factory nuts and they DO NOT include replacement nuts.  Which is just ""nuts"" right?<br />Again, no biggie. Quick trip to Lowes for correct nuts solved this.<br />Here is the big issue.  Unit will not heat! Spent time installing only to determine it is dead on arrival.  Will be shipping back.<br /><br />I know it is the element as I purchased a replacement locally (double the cost) but it heats well.<br /><br />Do not buy. Item is junk.",20
positive,Worked great.,20
positive,As good as the brand new GE brand for 1/4 the price. Will never go back!,20
negative,Did not work,20
negative,The lifespan of these filters is pretty terrible. I believe they actually advertise they be changed every three weeks.,20
positive,"Next time I need a vent it will be one like this. Not only does it work well, but it will not dry rot in the desert sunshine. I also was able to modify it with a bird guard that I attached with rivets.",20
positive,"Dryer came on time with Prime.<br />Delivery Team was excellent, friendly, and efficient. They hooked up electrical connections and venting, no charge just part of the excellent service provided, I was vey impressed. We used the Dryer for a couple of loads on the first day, works well so far.",20
positive,There is a small metal cylindrical clip that goes on the post that this knob sits on.  If you don't save the clip from the original knob then this one will sit loosely in place since it is not included in the package.,20
positive,They fit in the filter holder perfectly and the lid closes tight. I haven't had any loose grounds since using these.,20

negative,The advertisement said goose eggs  too<br />Not true<br />They absolutely do not fit goose eggsü•≤,20
positive,Filters are working great in my Keurig coffee maker.  The price  was a lot more reasonable that from the manufacturer.,20
positive,"Thank you for such a great bargain!  These filters are impossible to find and those rare times I do find them, the price is outrageous!",20
positive,This switch was easy to install and functions as intended. The original switch lasted over 15 years so we will have to  see if this one lasts longer.,20
negative,These filters do not affect the taste of the water. I replaced a more expensive filter with these because they were about 1/4 of the price. You get what you pay for. Will not buy again.,20
positive,"I bought these after trying the typical round locks you can find at Wal-Mart or Target. Turns out our door knobs are slightly larger than average and the basic locks weren't big enough to turn easily around them. I was desperate to find something to keep our very curious, very destructive 2 year old out of certain rooms.<br />These work perfectly! They fit easily onto our large knobs and are easier enough for adults and my 6 year old to use but too complicated for an impatient 2 year old.<br />Would highly recommend!",20

Unfortunately I still have a slight soapy/perfume taste 2 months after installation. I now only drink bottled water.,20
positive,"Great, direct replacement. Worked well",20

negative,Goes through all the motions but No Ice!,20
negative,"It worked as it should for a year, getting moderate use. It was used daily during the summer, but less frequently during the winter. Then one day it just stopped pumping water up to where the cubes are made, and gave an ""add water"" message even though the reservoir was full of water. I tried cleaning with vinegar, but that didn't help. They are now 25% off, so I am purchasing it again, hoping that I just got a lemon.",20

positive,Exactly what promised,20
positive,Sturdy product.,20
positive,"I've only just purchased these. So far, so good. On first usage, I found them very easy to use and they have worked without a flaw. I use a Keurig single cup maker at my office and although I use commercial cups to offer coffee to clients, I was looking for a way to have my favorite coffee blend for myself. These are very easy to use right out of the package (after washing). Easy to fill, they pop right in to the machine, once you see how to line them up with the machine. I have had no problems: no leaking, coffee tasted great, cups easy to wash out. I use the same amount of coffee I would use at home for one cup - a 2 tablespoon measure which is the amount of a standard coffee scoop. The set comes with a little coffee scoop making it easier and less messy to fill the reusable K-cup. Now that I know that 2 T comes to the top of the mesh openings, I find it easier to use the little scoop. This also helps keep any grounds off the top edge that might affect the seal. Keeping the lip clear of grounds was a helpful tip left by someone else in their review. Update: I am using these almost daily in a Keurig K-15 brewer and I have started using small paper disposable filters which make clean up even easier and allow me to put the filter and used grounds straight into the compostable garbage bin.",20

positive,"Does not match up with all Models as advertised, good product but was not able to use them.",20
positive,"I don't have the true blue K machine. I have a Hamilton Beach machine. The external recess on the bottom is insufficient and keeps the bottom of these k-cups from fully seating and puts unneeded pressure on the bottom piercing tube (possible deformation of the sharp point on the piercing tube possibly leading to premature failure of the tube) and this also causes the cup to &#34;ride&#34; up about .060&#34;. This positional error requires a small amount of additional pressure needed to close the assembly. AFTER READING NUMEROUS REVIEWS CONTAINING PROBLEMS with grinds getting through this k-cup and winding up in the coffee cup, I can offer the following: I used these cups with and without a paper filter; I filled the cup completely full and only half full {regular grind}; regardless of the combination, I had ZERO grinds in my cup. I DID HOWEVER CAREFULLY ENSURE THE THE LID WAS FULLY {COMPLETELY} SEATED. Those using only gentle finger pressure to close the lid will assuredly have grinds floating through the gap left from a lid that &#34;looks&#34; closed.<br />I will shop for a design that doesn't put pressure on the lower piercing tube otherwise I would be happy with this brand.",20

We had gone eight years before a technician doing other work suggested it was time to replace the evaporator panel.  Yep.  The instructions were good and we're probably set for another four years or so before it needs replacement again.,20
positive,Worked,20
positive,Just what I ordered!!,20
positive,Same as came with it.,20
negative,"It's OK but like anything that isn't totally necessary for the operation of an item, it's hard to judge just how effective it is at cleaning the air. I will most like continue to replace it once a year when I replace the water wick.",20
positive,"My Samsung washer went out, and so I replaced this part myself and saved time and money. Samsung technician was charging $80 to come out, and $80 for diagnostics. Not to mention, parts and labor costs. No more leaks and it runs great! I definitely recommend, and I would purchase again in the near future.",20
negative,Pay attention to the description.  The filters come to you as a big round circle. You have to fold each one twice before using it.,20
positive,Worked perfectly.  I went ahead and adjusted the rubber ring on the Keurig as suggested by several reviewers.  Had no spraying or leaking at all.  Just had to adjust the coffee amount a few times.  I am happy with it!,20
positive,"These are the best. I have looked for the right size forever. Works great , easy to clean. And durable. Was not costly at all and i recieved quickly.",20
positive,This was very easy to do myself.  Don't pay a plumber for sonething so simple.  On my dishwasher it took 15 mins and runs like new.,20
positive,Perfect!,20
negative,These so not fit as described,20
positive,Great value and works well...my second time ordering these,20
positive,correct fit and works well on Samsung DV350AEW dryer,20
negative,"I thought I was going to like this washer because it was just right for my needs. I was delighted with the ease of use. After a few loads, I was astonished  to find a large puddle underneath the washer because there was a leak in a hose. I had a repairman try to fix it, but it is leaking again. It is past time to return it, so I hope it can be fixed. I also have to replace my kitchen  laminate floor, which was ruined by the water. This ""low cost"" washer has ended up being very expensive! I hope that the seller will agree to let me return it for a refund. I am not sure if it has a guarantee for parts and labor. If so, I need to  make a claim with the manufacture.",20
positive,This is my second purchase of four of these filters because I liked the first ones so much. I‚Äôve bought other brands (brown) but the lids always pop open. These stay firmly shut and work very well in my old Keurig.,20
positive,Water filter as described,20
negative,This item was broken when it arrived. I was still able to use it. The switch was really easy to install. It fixed my issues.,20
positive,no issues,20
positive,Liked the moisture.,20
negative,"We had to adjust the flow to almost off once this was installed, otherwise the bin filled with water, it does work and the icemaker was not working before, it isn't exactly the same as factory installed, but it fit and was not difficult to install",20
positive,Very convenient.,20
positive,"I got my 3rd Keurig in February. It was not made like the past 2 I had. The Keurig just wasn't making a good cup of coffee anymore and when the machine started to be loud and malfunction, Keurig sent a nasty email and wouldn't cover it. SO, I was on the search for a new Kcup brewer.  I came across this one and am so glad that I did.  It looks nice on the counter, is easy to use and makes a nice bold flavorful cup of java!!  It may cost a bit more, but is worth every penny!!",20

positive,Perfect fit.  Exactly as described.,20

positive,Product as described,20
negative,The hunt continues,20
positive,"Matched the original part (which didn‚Äôt really need replacing, it was a diff part, but since I was in there.) Fridge works, so job done.",20
positive,Living in a studio apartment that came without no stove. This burner was a great idea. It is highly priced but it works well.,20
positive,it's exactly like the filters for the Cuisinart coffee maker at a much better price.,20
positive,"I loved how easily these were installed, and all that was needed was a pair of scissors.  They are very practical and easily removed for cleaning. I recommend, well worth the price, and the effort to install.",20
positive,Thank you so much and sorry for the late relay!!! Thank it‚Äôs works fine ! Thank,20
positive,Works great for the back of our dryer in our new home. Very pleased!,20
positive,Dishwasher stopped working completely. I disassembled  the door after watching a couple YouTube videos and tested for power before and after this fuse. Tests confirmed that the fuse was blown and replaced it with new fuse.  Saved me from buying a new dishwasher.,20
positive,"Some stuff i didn't know: (1) it drains by gravity. If you have a really small bathroom and not a lot of room for sturdy tables, you'll have to do some heavy lifting to get the water out. This machine is light weight without water, but when it's full and you have to lift it up to drain, not so much. (2) The power cord is kinda small. (3) only do 1 pair of jeans at a time otherwise the washer won't spin. (4) make sure you don't have ""drain"" on while refilling. I made this mistake and I see others do too. This is very easy to miss. (5) the drain hose is also small. Probably should do it in the tub but I couldn't because my power outlet is too far away.<br /><br />And some stuff I knew but good to know: (1) you have to manually do a rinse cycle by draining the soap water out and putting clean water in. (2) the ""dryer"" side is smaller than the wash side.<br /><br />Some extra stuff you may want: a shower head to refill. An extension for the power cord. A really sturdy table to elevate the machine so it can drain. Something breathable like a disposable sock to put at the end of your pipe so chunks don't clog your drain. A bucket might be good also.<br /><br />I would invest in the biggest version of this because there's no way I can do blankets and some other stuff. But this is really small and light if you want that (easy to hide).<br /><br />Used it to do my laundry and works as other people say it does, this is a good product not spectacular. Although the end result is pretty spectacular actually, my clothes is really really clean but the work to get there drops it down to just good for me (requires a lot more out of you than a standard washing/dryer). Build feels fragile especially for carrying water which makes it heavy and I think I cracked the plastic already in the back and the back plate is kinda misaligned now, nothing too major but again I only used it today. The spin or dryer part actually does a decent job but you still will have to hang dry it. You can actually wear the clothes immediately after use if you dont mind slightly damp clothes for like 15+ minutes (I don't, it's bareable). The dryer failed on me in a couple of ways already. Sometimes it violently shakes (not how it normally shakes, the drum seem to be misaligned and it bangs the clear plastic wall) and I have to stop it, shake it a little bit and start it again then it works, and sometimes it spins very slowly some times because there's too much water resistance on the bottom and sometimes it's just over heated i think??? Idk I hope it'll continue to work itself out over and over again in the future as it did today and I hope it will not be a major issue. Also the water from the washer side bleeds to the ""dryer"" side a lot but I think that's on me and not knowing how it works fully yet. The noise and vibrations is bareable. May need to hold in place if you're drying jeans or something heavy for 6 minutes or it could move ""walk"" around. The total time it takes to clean is about half a hour, including rinsing and drying but it taken me like 2+ hours to do 3 shirts, 3 jeans, socks, and underwear mostly cause I'm a newbie learning. Its a million times better than a laundromat. This ""feels"" like it's going to break on me within a week but I see others kept theirs for years so I don't know. I will update if it does break.",20
positive,Installed lid switch and the washer worked perfectly,20
positive,Bought icemaker for a Kenmore Refrigerator two months ago. Icemaker was very easy to install in less than 30 minutes. Began producing ice shortly after installation and has been going strong now for over two months. Great value!,20
positive,Check with you property manager first if you rent.,20
negative,"It was working ok until someday I discovered that it was completely off. I double-checked everything: it was still plugged and the plug was working fine with other devices. The conclusion is that the refrigerator is dead after only 3 years, which is super low compared to the lifetime of any electric appliance. I contacted Edge Star support and their only recommendation was to search google for help :(",20
positive,I love the ease of use! And the cute little ice shapes!,20
positive,These extenders served the purpose.  The fit wasn't as snug as I was hoping for--there are minor gaps between the range and the extenders but nowhere near as bad as before.  I would recommend these extenders to others.,20
positive,I use these every day. I love them. It's cheaper than buying k cups all the time. I can make my favorite coffee every day and it's not available in k cups yet.,20
positive,Works great as replacement on 8 year old mixer.  Was having issues with bowl slipping and coming off the base with bread or stiffer cookie doughs. This did the trick!,20
positive,Es buen producto,20
positive,We can't tell any difference between this and the much more expensive product offered by Samsung.,20
positive,Repairmen always charged a fortune to come fix the striker on the washer door and this is so simple and cheap to fix. I wish the door didn't hang down so that when you shut it you have to lift up on it or the striker clip breaks in the first place.,20
positive,"Works well, I just would like it to be less pliable, so it doesn't move so easily so that it stays in place better.",20
positive,Best thing to get,20
positive,Helped with my dryer! No more loud noises coming from the drum,20
positive,"Good fit, heavy aluminum foil",20
positive,"Bought this piece off amazon because it was about $20 cheaper! Works great, haven't had a problem since I installed it!",20
positive,Works well in my refrigerator. I like this filter better than others I have bought. It doesn‚Äôt have a smell in the water when you put it in.,20
positive,Ok,20
positive,"I honestly didn't know what to expect when ordering the Whirlpool 2261934 Meat Pan...it was EXACTLY like the pan I broke!! :-) Also, I really appreciate how well Amazon packaged this product for shipping...I am soooo pleased!!!",20
positive,"Seems to be doing a good job  The ice maker is producing clearer ice cubes than before .  It could be a coincidence, but I don't think so.  It is hard to judge but the price was so much cheaper than the name brand, I thought it was worth trying..",20
positive,I like every thing,20
positive,"While I can't speak at all to durability or longevity, I did receive the part quickly and it appears to be very high quality.  I was able to install it pretty quickly and it seems to be working fine.",20
negative,"I was hoping to be able to make my own pods instead of buying them but these pods filters will not stay sealed. At first I thought I was putting too much coffee in but they still would pop open. After taking all precautions to keep the edge clean and going by all of the instructions of the pod sealer for making pods, I decided it was worth the cost of pods instead of trying to make these work. If someone else has a way to make these work I would like to hear about it.",20
positive,Belt works well in Maytag MDE308DAYW dryer.,20
positive,Love it. Good quality. Nice subtle touch to kitchen. Keeps from dirty fingerprints on refrigerator and stove handles.,20
positive,"I ordered this heating element to carry as a spare for my Dometic DM2652 refrigerator. It looks exactly like the original, has quality wiring and connectors, and it tests right within the spec. They should be at 44 ohms, plus or minus 10%, and this one tests at 45.6 ohms, which is absolutely fine.<br /><br />I have full confidence this will work perfectly, and the asking price is quite a bit lower than many other offerings.<br /><br />Because my 10 year old element still tests within spec (42 ohms), I'm not going to replace it yet, but if I do and have any difficulties with this one, I will come back and edit my review.",20
positive,It is way much better than the cheap ones.,20
positive,Everything I expected fit well easy to clean look good.,20
positive,Same filter that GE sells. Super easy to install.,20
positive,"Easily installed, looks great, time will tell if they work. So far so good, will update if there is anything to report.",20
positive,The item was a perfect fit for my GE Profile front load washer.  The installation took 15 minutes and I was up and running the washer in no time.  Prime shipping got the valve here much faster than if I was to order it from an appliance wholesale parts store online.  Gotta love Prime.,20
negative,"These are cheaply made which is why I ordered two incase one broke. Well, I broke already and I didn't even have it 4 months.",20
positive,"Works well with my refrigerator. Reasonable price and arrived quickly, thank you!",20
positive,"The Icemaker Kit replaced the Icemaker unit in a 2007 GE Profile refrigerator, Model #PSC23NSWA SS.  The diagnosis of the issue appeared to be a defective heating coil (at least we hoped that was the case and it was). There was a slight difference in plug-in wiring, etc between the 2007 unit and the 2017 Icemaker Kit purchased.<br />It is great to have a working icemaking refrigerator again!",20
negative,It was not what I was expecting,20
negative,Did not work at all,20
positive,Furnace technician quoted me a price of $348 to replace. I bought this and replaced it myself.,20
positive,Works very well and had almost everything that I needed. I did have to go to Home Depot for a few extra pieces. No pin or other couplings were included in the kit. It did however have the locking clips to help deter the hose from slipping out of the couplings. All in all satisfied with the hoses and simple assembly.,20

negative,Overpriced piece of aluminum foil,20
negative,Would not buy again.,20
positive,"I'll give it 5 stars because it is working well.  I'm rounding up from 4.5, as the kit didn't come with an additional ring I needed, but it doesn't show in the picture either.<br /><br />Quality-wise, it's well manufactured, and fit perfectly on my washing machine.",20

positive,"great price, recieved quickly, factory belt not generic",20
positive,Super fast delivery and just what I needed,20
positive,"Exactly what I need, more reasonably priced than the local hardware stores or the actual mfgtr. I'll have to file away the item number since Frigidaire made it a treasure hunt to find the correct one/item # for our fridge(less than a year old.....how tacky). Came reasonably quick too",20
positive,I love this thing. Great price for important information.,20
positive,I still checking on this product. To recent to give a feedback,20
positive,Super easy to install.,20
positive,If your looking for something to keep your eggs organized this it. These containers are durable and stack together to free up space in your refrigerator. Another benefit is that the both come with lids to help preserve the freshness of the eggs and to protect them as well. Overall happy with my purchase and recommend them.,20
positive,Excellent.  Perfect.,20
positive,"I love this little ice machine.  It can be a little noisy when it is filling the water to freeze but other than that, it makes the ice really fast.  I think it cycles the ice every 7 minutes (could be less, I never timed it).  The ice is perfect, it is the ""good"" ice.",20
positive,"Seems to be working!  Darned things are expensive; but if it's getting rid of some of the 'bad stuff' in the water, I guess it's worth it!  Can't really taste a difference with our pretty good tap water; but happy to filter our water just in case.",20
positive,this Jenn-AIr Dishwasher door handle worked fine...not that easy to install<br />I have nothing more to write....this is it...the end,20
negative,Installed July 23rd n broke Sept 6th<br />They get ya good because you have to buy the whole thing again if just one section breaks! Manufacturing thieves!,20
positive,Peace of mind with one year old wanting to turn everything on. Works great. Great value.,20
negative,"I was so excited to start hand-washing our clothes with the help of an electric spinner to wring them out better than my hands are able to. Unfortunately, this clothes spinner didn't work out of the box. It beeps when I close the lid and I can smell electrical components (burning?) when it's turned on, but the barrel inside is lopsided (stuck to one side) and does not spin at all.<br /><br />When I reached out to Amazon's product support team, I was put on hold while they called the manufacturer (at almost 9pm EST...  of course they were closed...). I was then told that they would call me tomorrow, after they are able to reach out to the manufacturer during normal business hours.<br /><br />""Out-of-the-box defective"" should equate to a full refund. Period. I would love to try a new one (this one had signs of being a refurbished machine, with 2 broken pieces of plastic in the drum upon opening it and wear on the hinge side of the blue plastic lid) or different spinner, purchased through Amazon, but this one needs to go and I need one that works. I have never written a bad review for anything I've ever purchased on Amazon, but this is pretty ridiculous. I would not have spent over $160 on this if I had known that the manufacturer sells broken/refurbished items. This one in particular was ""Sold by: Amazon.com Services LLC"" and I would like a full replacement/refund, please. I will update this review/remove the bad rating if this is handled properly.<br /><br />EDIT: Amazon refunded me the full amount I paid for the dryer and told me to dispose of the broken unit however I saw fit (meaning I didn't have to return it). I greatly appreciate that they gave me a full refund, although I did have to call twice in order to get them to process it.<br /><br />Leaving my review at 1 star for the product/company because they shipped a faulty machine, but Amazon has regained my trust.",20
positive,Better price than going through the manufacturer of my refrigerator.,20

positive,Great purchase for the summer.,20
positive,"We installed another brand dishwasher vent that had the metal jacket press on over the air gap, it leaked all over the counter.  This unit has a cover that screws to the plastic air gap inside and does not leak all over the counter.",20
positive,Great product for the price.,20
positive,This is the third room hygrometer I have purchased.  The first two were always in disagreement.  Reading reviews of these units convinced me that anything low cost was unreliable.  This unit responds quickly and gives readings that are consistent and that appear to be withing a couple of percent of the relative humidity. I highly recommend it.,20
positive,Exactly what I needed,20
positive,As mention in previous reviews  this part is made of great quality! 20 mins to change and best of it don't have to buy new washer!,20
negative,Only one clip  it cost too much,20
positive,These are flexible and fit the dishwasher racks. I actually used them to cover the raw edges of my farm sink's stainless rack after I had it cut in half. I wanted the rack to fit for washing in my dishwasher. End caps stayed on and did not dry out.,20

positive,Perfect for sticks.,20
positive,"Great it is sturdy and easy to clean, no more of those store cartons in the refrigerator, saves space. I would recommend this product and it saves space.",20
positive,The procuct was less then half the price of the original filter. Good fit. No leaks. I ordered two and there shrink wrapped so they stay clean. Very good product.,20
positive,Works fine,20
negative,"I do not drink coffee. I am looking at reviews for a friend and was told that this My K-Cup can also make hot chocolate. After reading reviews (for this product and the paper kind), I can only think that coffee drinking is a cult or an addiction. Really? Go to this much trouble for something to drink? No wonder the K-Cups are so popular even though ""expensive"".<br />I will make my hot chocolate another way and I am certain that my friend will not go to the trouble of all this fine tuning for getting the right flavor of coffee. So I am not going to get any of these ""land fill saving"" products. Just stop drinking coffee if you are so damned concerned with the environment or the expense.<br />Also, I am certainly confused. Keurig says to use coarse ground, and some agree. Others say use fine ground. Most who tinker say to modify the My K-Cup by adding a used piece from the K-Cups. I don't understand why Keurig has not modified the My K-Cup and clearly explained to people which coarseness to use. I am so glad that I do not care!<br />Malcolm",20
positive,"Replaced my existing cranky fan motor. The shaft diameter was different than the original, but with the included fan blade there was no problem with installation. This was a 5 minute replacement and no joke.",20
positive,I would rather have this instead of the keurig. Super easy to clean. Comes with a cleaning brush. Feels sturdy not flimsy or weak. Used for a whole week twice a day and no clogs or anything.,20
positive,Besides Candy Canes I love Snowmen with personality and this looks great on metal door,20
positive,"This is exactly what I was looking for. My dryer and outside vent hose match up very closely but my vent is a roof exhaust and is a vertical connection. I had a flex hose previously that worked just fine but it drove me crazy having the hose making so many twists and turns. The instructions were very basic and had no detail. The flex hose ends of the connectors were very secure. The same cannot be said for the dryer and vent side connections. Once installed they can very easily be pulled off with very little force or bump. Luckily for me the dryer vent with the elbow and the exhaust vent are only offset about 2"" and are very close together (10""). So the elbow is pressed against the wall. I stretched and used the entire length of hose so it would stack/support itself and there is very little weight on the vent side connector. So far after 2 weeks of use I have had no issues. If they included a couple sizes/thickness of the grip rings to go on the hard vent pipe that would solve the issue.",20
positive,Filter look cheap comparing to Kenmore filter one which has bue and clear casing. I did not have bad taste as some stated.,20
positive,We have 6 in our family so at supper time we are limited on how much ice we get. Works good! Makes some noises but not too loud.,20

positive,"So I tried everything from the gasket to the spray arm to other random things. Turned out that the door vent was clogged. There was 15 years of gunk that needed cleaning. Once I that, no more leaks!",20
positive,Compare this to the name brands out there and you'll quickly discover as did I; this stuff gets your coffee pot sparkly again with great tasting brew at a price that can't be beat.,20
positive,"Perfect Ice Machine for our needs!  This ice maker is not very noisy, I would describe the noise levels as minimal.  We have enjoyed having fresh ice on hand all summer!  We use bottled water when filling our ice maker, leaving the ice flavorless!  The machine makes Ice very quickly.",20
positive,Amazon's price for the product was outstanding!  Best to use this in the coffee pot especially if you have hard water even if you also have a water softener.  Makes the coffee taste outstanding.,20
positive,Worked as adverised. The price was better than we could find locally. What can I say it's a water filter.,20
negative,The first one leaked from the start. After a couple minutes I realized it wasn‚Äôt a seal issue but infact it was leaking from where the top of the filter connects to the bottom of the filter(pictured).Luckily I bought the three pack and the second one is issue free for now.,20

I think the cost could come way down. 03 generators just aren't that expensive to build in general and this one in particular. Hopefully it holds up.<br /><br />Update: I've had this for, I don't know, maybe a year. There's no indication that it does anything. I still have to bleach the front loader smell out, still have to use detergent. I tried cold water no detergent for a long time. A friend has a more expensive unit; he left his wash in the machine when he went out of town for two weeks and it had the faintest front loader odor. Two weeks!

positive,"Our grocery store has started selling eggs in bulk packs of 30, which fit nicely in our fridge, but the clamshell packing is a pain to open, and is very loud.  I bought this to keep the eggs stored neatly, and to have easier access to them.  As I had hoped, both drawers are easily swapped back and forth, which helps us to move the older eggs to the top and the newer to the bottom.<br /><br />I will note that the drawers themselves seem thin, and maybe with some pressure would bend or break, but so far so good!  (It's thin plastic, but definitely does the job it needs to do.)  The outside box that encases the drawers is very sturdy, and I use the top of it as a spot to put meat on top of to thaw for the next day.  A lot easier to clean the top of that than it is to pull everything out of the fridge!",20

positive,"I purchased this to replace an old, yellowed vent that the lid had cracked off.  This was a big improvement.  The lid fits tightly and the flow from dryer is strong enough to lift the internal cap with ease.<br /><br />Since my vent is on the south side of the house and receives daily sun exposure, I followed others recommendations to paint it.  I chose some white spray paint formulated for plastics.  A few light coats and the vent is now protected from UV and blends nicely with the white house.<br /><br />You might need to have a tube of silicon around for when you mount it to the house if it is not flush.  Mine mounted perfectly to the existing mount after I drilled 2 new holes.",20

negative,"This replacement unit looks great and, in my case, did its job for about 24 months.  The problem is that the knurled hole teeth pulsator core with its internal grooved design is the sole attachment to the washing machine agitator. The internal grooves wore out in 24 months.  Upon inspection the grooved attachment was worn completely smooth.  When this occurs the agitator/pulsator no longer rotates and you need to re-purchase another replacement pulsator unit.  Perhaps the unit is only engineered  for a 2 year lifespan as the price is quite reasonable.  The delivery time was excellent but I was very disappointed with the product lifespan.  Perhaps I would have had better results had I purchased a genuine LG replacement part?",20

positive,"I have an older (2005, when my home was built!) GE Triton XL which needed a few wheels, as the posts eventually broke on them, and I had to keep popping them back on, repeatedly. I looked at the Sears and GE websites to determine the part number and matched them to this one, and they are indeed a perfect fit! So I paid $9.99 for eight (so I have four spares!), and the ‚Äúgenuine part‚Äù which is also just plastic runs about $25 PER WHEEL! Crazy! Highly recommend these, just look at the parts listing for your machine so you‚Äôre sure they match when you enter the details in the matching tool üëç",20

positive,"Gas-powered clothes dryer kept breaking. Repair dude charged me $300 (of which $70 for the part). It lasted one day, then broke again. What repair dude didn't tell me (of course): cause of breaking was overheating, caused by lint build-up in the exhaust hose. You need to clean those regularly (sweep tool with flexible extension rod available at DIY stores for like $23).<br />Getting to the ignition part inside the dryer is a b1tch - you need to take the thing completely apart, drum and all. Watch YouTube videos on how to do it. But it is doable unless you have two left hands. No special tools needed, but a short Phillips screw driver helps since otherwise the angle is not convenient to get the ignition piece out. Good luck.",20

positive,Great value!,20
positive,"Based on the symptom that the ice flap didn't close after dispensing, having to push it manually (which I discovered after my freezer frosted over because air was getting in) I ordered this.

Most last a few months.  I had one install a couple back last over a year.  It's just a symptom of a poor design by Samsung.  I chose this vendor solely on price.  They seem to care about their customers satisfaction more than others I've purchased from.  I can't provide feedback since It's only been 3 days since parts have been installed.

When installing the new one just make a drawing and mark the plugs with numbers so you don't get confused about where thing go back. Also after things are disconnected from the old board put on a pair of leather gloves before pulling it off, there are many sharp ponts on the other side.

It was my husband's first time trying it and that one mistake made this product completely unusable.  Just fair warning, be careful not to overload it!<br /><br />I used it a few times before it snapped and it worked pretty well.  Don't think it will replace what a washer does, since it only washes about a 5 gallon bucket worth of clothes at a time, and basically it just suctions the water so the clothes are swishing around getting the soap to do it's job better.  It's like...a step up from swishing them in a bucket of soap with your hands or a big stick.",20
positive,"Easy installation. Fixed my problem in about five minutes. If your control panel has gone totally black, no power to it, it might be this thermal protector.

I am now looking for more information about what I bought, but it makes me not trust this storefront to accurately represent their merchandise. Why not just advertise what they actually sell?",20

positive,"If you look at your old pump, it's a straightforward, easy to interpret DIY replacement. This matches up like OEM and is a piece of cake to install.

We included this as part of a kitchen remodel, and unfortunately ended up with a damaged cabinet from condensation.  We were running the unit at 45*, which is apparently too cold??  Granted, we are in South Florida, so perhaps a 78* home, and being built in, was just too much for it?  We're running it at 60* now, and have had no additional problems.  Just be aware, and test yours at lower temps.",20
positive,Just installed one day ago. So far so good. Easy install and making ice just fine. The little plate that goes on to the full arm fell off but was easy enough to put back on. I am apprehensive after reading other reviews.<br />I‚Äôll update at a later time.,20

negative,"I knew before I ordered this part it would be a hit-or-miss proposition of whether or not the manufacturer could figure out which direction the cycle selection arrow should point, based upon reading the MANY other frustrations of others. Unfortunately, mine fell into the &#34;they built it wrong&#34; group and is 45 degrees off. Had to mark a brand-new part with a Sharpie. ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS that, for any price, this can't be constructed correctly at the factory. The fact they charge $15 for a piece of incorrectly molded plastic just ups the annoyance factor.

positive,"If you need the belt and have the DV448AEW series, the belt included here is a touch too long, or at least the one I got was. With the kit installed and new felt on both ends, the belt loses friction on the drum when wet clothes are inside and just spins without moving the drum. Attempted a second spring for more tension, but did not help. Existing belt was not too old and in great shape, so I was fine; the wheels and studs were the reason I purchased this kit, not the belt. If the belt fit, it's 5/5 instead, but for the price and my needs, it still did the job great. ""ease of install"" will depend on your level of comfort tearing down a dryer.",20

Sure enough, this is the exact same bin that came with our fridge. It was super simple to put in and I saved around $60 from buying from an appliance parts store. Super happy with this product!

positive,This must be about the most boring thing I have ever written a review on.  Fits like the original on my LG dryer.  Works fine.,20
negative,Did ok for about a month then started making a horrible noise when pumping water.,20
positive,"Saved a bunch of money on this DIY project.  Very easy to install. . .just be careful like many comments said - don't let the connectors suck back up into the insulation.  Hindsight, I would've used vice grips to grab them.  Good price and perfect fit.",20
positive,Was perfect fit!  Great value...especially for a hard to find item which is probably because everyone is converting to Kerigs now.,20
positive,I loooove this ice maker it makes that nugget type ice that's similar to the ice you get from Sonic if you like eating ice you will love the ice from this. Would definitely recommend,20
positive,Nice replacement for the money. One star off for slower water flaw. I'd buy it again.,20
positive,Easy to replace!,20
positive,Got these for my friends dryer...they were payin $13 for 1 @ a local store...not anymore!,20
negative,The filters we received were not official. They were the wrong size to big for 10 cupper. That‚Äôs what we ordered,20
negative,"Be sure what you order is exactly what you need for your model.  Firebird doesn‚Äôt sell all of the model filters they make through Amazon.  We had to return, pay restock fee, and then order correct filter for our model.  It seems a little peculiar.",20
positive,Perfect. Great quality.,20
positive,It is a nice filter that actually seems to last longer than the AirCare MA 1201 refills.,20
positive,It is needed for my fridge and it lasts a decent amount of time per my usage.,20
positive,"We purchased this filter to replace a universal filter in our mothers Essick MA0800 Humidifier. The old universal filter that was bought for her at Lowes had a light fabric type outer wrap & she had to cut it & piece it together to mark it fit. This old filter was terrible, her humidifier would run for days without using up any water. The worst part was that it developed mold on the bottom edges & she & her daughter had been having recurring illness. It also was the cause of her apartment smelling like a locker room (in her words). We installed this filter in her humidifier after cleaning it with Peroxide & also bought her some bacteriostat to add to the water. The humidifier is happy again & working like new again. Be careful when substituting the original filter with a universal filter, if the universal filter has a fabric outer lining watch your humidifier carefully. She thought she was going to need a new humidifier, but now she is very happy. The original filter is a Essick MAF2  and is round in shape out of the box, not flat.",20
positive,This is the 3rd package of these that we have bought.  We love them.  When they get dirty you just throw them away.,20
positive,Es f√°cil de limpiar y funciona exactamente como indica,20
positive,Pretty easy set up initially and easy to clean. Makes great sonic ice.,20
positive,"Never used these filters before, took a chance on them, seem to be working fine, will buy them again, when needed.",20

positive,My old ice maker stopped making ice. This replacement was super easy,20
positive,Seems to work,20
positive,Love it just what I needed,20
positive,"This worked perfectly for me and after reading the instructions and watching a couple of youtube videos I was able to do it myself. I'm not a handy person by any means, mostly too stubborn to give up, but never got to that point with this project. It actually was very simple and straightforward, and saved me the labor cost of hiring someone else to do the job. The shipping was fast, too, so don't hesitate!",20
positive,Great deal for a 3 pack and it works just the same as oem.,20
positive,Works as advertised,20
negative,I had higher expectations for this and my eggs look sitting in them as the slots are a bit larger than the eggs from my chickens. Also they don‚Äôt roll to the front as well as I expected them too. If the row isn‚Äôt full it‚Äôs not in the front for you tel grab and I have to tilt it to get them to come forward for me to grab.,20
positive,Fits my Kenmore fridge perfectly and the price for 2 is less than the price of 1 at Sears.,20
positive,"I love Lavazza coffee. I purchase both the decaf and the regular espresso beans from Amazon through subscribe and save. I have a burr grinder and am able to grind the beans fine enough for Nespresso coffee brewing. The seals are pretty easy to use and the brush and measuring scoop that came with the original set should be your first purchase. The hacks on the internet are far more complicated and look to be less reliable. So instead of $1.10 per cup of fabulous Nespresso blends, I have my favorite Lavazza crema. I can also add cinnamon to the blend for a festive cuppa. My spouse continues to enjoy an assortment of Nespresso blends, so we have the ""best of both worlds!""",20
positive,"LG washer was starting to grind after 13 years.  Called my go-to repair guy who said ""it'll cost you less to buy a new one"" than to have him repair it.  Not wanting to drop a thousand dollars or more on a new washer (and of course would need to get the matching dryer to keep wife happy, add another grand or so), I decided after watching a couple Youtube videos that I'd give it a go.  I also ordered the ""spider"" https://amzn.to/3y7D0F3 just in case I needed to replace it while it was all apart (didn't need it, Amazon took it back without issue). As you can see in the photo, you need to take the washer COMPLETELY apart to replace the bearings.  It really isn't complicated, just time consuming and you need to be careful to label every screw and bolt you take off to make sure you put it back together right.  Once apart, I pressure washed the drum to remove the build up, then proceeded to replacing the bearings.  Emory cloth https://amzn.to/31IrDHF was a worthwhile purchase to clean up the drum shaft.  Job was about 5 hours for me, but next time I could probably do it in half that.  I did forget to get some thread locker (https://amzn.to/3DzMHNr) and had to run to the hardware store before I could re-assemble.  It's been a couple months since I replaced the bearings, so far, so good!",20
positive,These fit perfectly in my Keurig 550 and they do what they are supposed to and improve the taste and flavor of the water. Why pay 4 times more for the name brand?,20
negative,"Purchased this pack of FOUR.  Upon changing the filter for the 4th time (every 3 months) this last unit was defective and flooded my whole refrigerator and my kitchen floor.  In fact, I believe the other three filters were defective too as the water literally dribbled into our glasses.",20
positive,"Don;t really know if these filters work because I don't know how to tell that.  However, the price was great (beat our local prices by 50%) and the service fast.  Would highly recommend this purchase.  The filters do grab tons of dog hair (and you can actually scoop out the dog hair- we have four dogs and a cat).  They last much longer than the smaller filters and came with a great review from our local HVAC company that charged us twice this price for them.<br />I would recommend them and would highly recommend this source for purchases.",20
negative,"Disappointed,Flavor from a Dark ground right for device,is very weak",20
negative,"If you're looking at these to replace the lid of the first My K-Cup, the one without the adaptor, go ahead and order these.  I have a Keurig 2.0 400 series and there is no problem whatsoever.  These are identical to the original lid.  Pay attention to securely tightening the lid until the silicone seal is broken in.  If you grind your beans coarse you don't need a paper filter insert.<br /><br />Update:  These are very delicate.  All three have developed hairline cracks in a relatively short time.  I have lowered my rating to 2 stars.",20
negative,"Per conversation with official GE parts department, this is the correct gasket part # for my specific GE Profile refrigerator.  However, like other purchasers of this part, the Gasket was not thick enough to close the gap between the refrigerator door and refrigerator body, thus allowing the cold air to escape.  Returned the part.  I‚Äôm not happy with this purchased, but am happy with Amazon‚Äôs return policy!",20
negative,"Does not fit, I will return my product.",20
positive,"Its so compact, its fabulous",20

positive,I bought this coffee dripper because I drink several cups of coffee in the morning.<br />When the power goes out I'm lost.( Instant coffee is not an option) Since we have a gas stove I can always heat water regardless and enjoy my coffee even without power!,20

positive,"I had the first large  Cuisinart single brewer back in 2011.  I kept it in my kitchen, 3 users plus visitors.  End of 2013, I renovated master bath. It was a master bath, rather large room, so I decided to buy a coffeemaker for my morning coffee( I didn‚Äôt have to go downstairs for that first cup) ...I bought the ‚Äúother brand‚Äù ...I brewed water after every 2 cups of coffee, ran vinegar 2x every 3 weeks( only made 4 cups a day from it) Boom! One year and one day later it died in me. I bought another ‚Äúother‚Äù brand, larger model...Again, year and month later, boom! Died... The Cuisinart finally gave way in early 2017.. almost 6 full years!! I retired my 4th Keurig (4 years, 4 Keurigs) ...I‚Äôm done! Last December and went back to my Cuisinart (dispenser)  coffeemaker...no carafe ( love it! ). But not practical for one person coffee. Within the next few weeks, I am ordering another Cuisinart (SS10) from Amazon...It‚Äôs saved for later.... ya just can‚Äôt beat it!  I find that if you clean the coffeemaker regularly, and use a filtered water to make the coffee, in addition to filter in the tank, scale does not have time to accumulate... When cleaning, I also leave vinegar in brewing tank overnight...rinse thoroughly next day.  Very happy with cuisinart products!",20
negative,"Seemed like a good idea but they aren't very attractive. They take away from the sleek look of the fridge.<br /><br />Easier to wipe down the handle than to take these off when dirty, clean them and struggle back on.<br />Sent them back.",20
positive,"My ice maker stopped making ice after who knows how many years.  I bought this one because it was inexpensive.  Received it the next day and removed the old one and installed the new one in about 5 minutes.  By the next morning, I had a full bin of ice.  It couldn't have been easier.  Just don't remove the two screws that attach it to the freezer.  Loosen them enough that you can remove and replace.",20
positive,"Everything is working well, just a note tho, the connectors it comes with won‚Äôt fit a home brew corny keg (ball lock). Everything else has been great, just had to order the correct fittings to fit my setup.",20
positive,Needed a new cartridge for an older Vicks humidifier.  These work perfectly.,20
positive,"I have not used yet, but I love the price of this GE compatible water filter.",20
positive,So much better than the higher priced ones sold in the hardware store.,20
positive,Works,20
positive,Fast shipping. Well packaged. Difficult to remove old bearings. Be patient and allow plenty of time to install new ones to prevent damage.,20
negative,"Had the product just over a year and the heating element burned in half, I‚Äôve contacted the company because they advertise a 2 year warranty on this product.  They will not respond to emails or phone calls.  Other than that the product fixed my problem for about 15 months",20

positive,Nothing,20
positive,"Quick. Fast. And easy. The simplicity of the design is beautiful. I love that it can power through a mountain of laundry in no time, 30 minutes to wash 30 to dry, or less, and a big load of laundry is folded and put away in 1 hour or less. Clean and fresh smelling. It doesn't hook into a computer, doesn't sing cute little tunes, no flashy gimmicky lights, no mildewy smell, uses WATER, no control temp regulators, AND CLOTHES ARE CLEAN first time around!!!! What more could you ask for??!!",20

positive,It was very easy to install!,20
positive,"Before I bought this it would drive me nuts that the rest of the family would not let the washer air dry, they would immediately close the washer right after using it making it smell like old rags, I would go nuts using all the products possible to prevent and make the smell go away and it would but when they would close the door right after washing it would come back. Since I've bought this there is no more smell, it is easy to sue so everyone always uses it.",20
negative,Package arrived with no content.,20
positive,I finally got the right replacement for my fridge. Great price and quick delivery,20

negative,Did not receive Aqua-Pure brand as advertised.  Received Pureline brand.  Hope there isn't any difference.,20
positive,This filter was easier to insert into my refrigerator than the original one that was made for the fridge.  I followed the directions and do not note any water taste change with this one.  This filter costs about $21 (without the promotion) less than the brand I was buying at the big box store.,20
positive,Worked great,20
negative,Did not work.  Tested open.  Returned.  Got another from a different vendor which worked.,20
positive,Fast delivery and just what I needed to fix washer.,20
positive,I received 5 two-packs (10) as advertised.  They were just as I expected and very similar or the same as others which I've purchased in grocery or hardware stores.  Good price and at shipped right to my door - that's what I like.,20
positive,Good fit and function. Just be careful when you clip off the extra length of the knob stem. It is easy to break it off too short.,20
positive,Great price,20
positive,Product says lifetime warranty but there is no way to contact seller to honor warranty.,20
positive,WILL ORDER AGAIN,20
negative,Doesn't work at all with my B130 Keurig despite the product description that it does.I filled with my regular brand coffee and placed the reusable K cup with the hinge portion of the lid facing the back of the machine as the instructions state. Lid would not close at all and I didn't want to force it and potentially damage the machine. Just a waste of my money.,20
positive,Works just great in my GE refrigerator.  Price through GE was higher.  They are more convenient than replacing the line filter which was installed in the water line but $45 for a filter is expensive to me.  According to GE must be replaced every mos. so I will continue to look on Amazon for lower priced ones.,20
positive,"Well made, no leaks.",20
positive,"The product was easy to install , it took about 5-7 minutes.",20
positive,"OK this filter is not a RPWFE, but it takes less than one minute to convert it, saving $40 per filter...",20
positive,great,20
positive,This ice maker has gotten a LOT of use in the past year I have owned it and would highly recommend to anyone wanting a countertop maker.  I hate the bullet kind of ice so when I saw this I had to get it!  I would buy this again if it ever dies on me - I did also buy one as a gift for Christmas for a family member as well.,20
negative,They are too short to sit down in the filter.  Coffee makes a mess. It‚Äôs not any easier to clean up than without it. very disappointed.,20
positive,I am a Jennifer Garant fan anyway.  I love this addition to my kitchen decor.,20
negative,I have ordered these before but this one didn't have the heavy metal piece inside. So it seems light and cheap. But it was still the same expensive price. I guess there was no way of knowing if that piece would be there or not. It doesn't look different but it feels different.,20
positive,"Perfect for our dryer and with the help of an YouTube video - it was relatively easy to install.  Just take the front off the bottom, unhook some wires, and pull the old one out... then slide the new one in and reconnect the wires.  Works great.",20
positive,So far so good. Clothes get wrinkled a lot so have an iron ready lol. Easy to understand and use. Thanks.,20
positive,I like that it doesn‚Äôt take up too much room and has a great value for what it does,20
positive,"This is good if you use the My Kcup in your Keurig. It makes it easy to fill some ahead of time,so in the morning you just have to get one in your Kcup and your good to go. It also makes cleanup easier, just throw away. Just remember to use it with the my Kcup and not the part that you put regular Kcups in.Saves time and money.",20

positive,"We decided to stack our machines when we moved our laundry room to a different space in our house. As a result, we were looking to change our dryer from a traditional rear discharge to a side discharge due to lack of space behind the machines. This kit was perfect and provided all the necessary parts for our left hand discharge. As a note, it came with all the necessary piping for left-hand, right hand and bottom discharge. This was perfect for us. We are very happy with the purchase.",20

positive,"I like the fact that you are in S.A. I live just up the road, and may need you again, Thanks",20
positive,easy to use ground coffee in a one cup coffee pot. easy to clean.,20
positive,"The OEM burner is $70. Here I get 4 for $35. Get what you pay for? No, in this case I can't tell any difference in quality between the OEM burners and this replacement. The OEM burners are 10 years old and the gas orifices were beginning to narrow with build up. These replacements return the stove to great performance.<br /><br />One starter connector was using a wide spade connector so I had to reuse with new burner. Swapped over fine. The  other 3 were plug and play. Starter works just as before. Burners include clamps at bottom orifice to control air mix and adjustment was simple.<br /><br />Although OEM burners were gray, these black ones fit fine. Thanks!",20

positive,Keeps two dozen eggs from cracking and keeps the refrigerator in order.,20
negative,"these don't work as well as other brands and definitely not as well as the far more expensive ones I've gotten from the company. if I keep everything wet at all times, they last longer.",20
positive,"These work exactly as you'd expect. Put in the coffee, snap it closed, and drop it into the Keurig machine. (Make sure to line up the arrows properly.) I had tried a different type of reusable before this, but that one required me to keep buying filters for it. This one has a metal mesh filter built in, so there's nothing to replace. Just rinse and reuse.<br /><br />I love the convenience of the Keurig, but have become concerned by the amount of waste they produce. This not only takes care of that, but it's much cheaper than using the one-use K-cups. You can put any type of coffee you want into these.",20
positive,Very easy to install.,20
positive,"Cheaper fridge filters, in comparison to the Samsung.  I have not had a problem with them so far.  Work pretty well.",20
positive,Came fast and was an exact fit,20
negative,The metal part that you screw the part to the refrigerator with was backwards. I wasn‚Äôt able to screw it in to secure it. For the most part it stayed in place though.,20
positive,"OK everyone hates replacing their dryer hose. In our house, a lot of cussing happens. That little metal ring that goes around the hose to keep it attached to the back of the dryer‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs horrible! So this thing it‚Äôs different. It‚Äôs wonderful! It‚Äôs easy! And it‚Äôs sturdy!!",20
negative,"A little difficult to fit compared to original, but once in place no issues with leaking. What a great price, but I guess you get what you pay for‚Ä¶ Even after a week of use, there was an unpleasant taste to the water that we didn‚Äôt experience with the original filter. We may just be in an area that has hard to deal with water contaminants, but unfortunately for my wallet it‚Äôs going to have to be Samsung originals going forward.",20
positive,Worked great on my fridge.,20

I wasn‚Äôt sure about the minor differences in all of them, whether that could cause the filter to not fit or work well. These were the right combo and price.

positive,Did the trick and saved us lots of money. Easy installation,20
positive,very fast delivery- and they are just what I wanted.  Handy and ready to go once filled- and so much cheaper than the pods you buy,20
negative,Plastic tub is thin but ok however I haven‚Äôt put water in it yet. Clearly no way to use the included hose or clamps. Hose is too short so figure another 10-15$ at Lowe‚Äôs for a longer hose and real clamps as well as some sort of mount as there isn‚Äôt one.,20
positive,"We live in an area with really hard water.  Our water and ice dispenser in the refrigerator door had stopped working.  After a little internet research, we decided we should try changing out the filter.  These filters are a great price and work perfectly.  We replaced the filter about 2 months ago and have no complaints.  We will buy them again in the future.",20
negative,"This is a piece of crap. There was plastic flashing everywhere. The center support broke. Not worth returning but if you can find another brand besides Ventline that fits I would say go for it. This parts has been made for almost 15 years and I think the molding tooling is also 15 years old and ahould be replaced, but apparently Ventline has no quality standard and don't care about their product quality.",20

Upon arrival this morning, I tested it on my induction cook top.<br />It only took two minutes to bring 16+ oz's to boiling. This clever  FlamGen Milk Frothing Pitcher's handle is heat resistant, I felt no heat in it at all with induction cooking, I was able to just pick it up and pour without a mitt.<br />Did I say I love this thing? Well done FlamGen!",20
positive,Just as expected. The filters were identical to the one that was put in when we had the humidifier installed.,20
negative,The adjustable arms on the egg holder has to be at least 1 inch longer it cannot fit for some refrigerators shelves because the adjustable arms cannot make it to the locking point the company should resize the adjustable arms to lock in.  Add at least 1 inch to the length of the locking arms 0 for the sturdiness of this product and because the short arms starts to buckle the egg holder frame.,20

Machine is temperamental, some times we have to ""fiddle"" with it or it does not work.<br />The top area where you put water in the canister is really just a bad design.  You should be able to fill it from the top but you have to take the whole canister off the machine.<br /><br />Would I purchase again? NO<br /><br />But I wanted to give this machine a fair shake so I kept it past the time to return.",20

positive,"If your buying this pump because your washer will not drain.  Make sure you check the upper most part of the drain hose, it is the part that has a plastic ball in it.<br />This pump was easy to replace and worked perfectly.  However it did not solve my problem.  I found a rag in the upper drain hose (See photo).<br />So make sure you sweep all the drain hose before purchasing anything for your washer.  If the pump is actually broken, this is an excellent choice.",20

positive,I only used the ignitor and am saving the other parts for future use as needed.  The ignitor and included bracket fit perfectly and work flawlessly.,20
negative,Very dissatisfied. The filter had a metallic/chlorine taste (even after running it for 15 minutes). We drank the water anyway. It caused me to have a headache everyday. Once I stopped drinking the water from the fridge the headaches went away. We replaced the filter with an LG filter. No chlorine taste. No headaches.,20
positive,These were great for one shot but if your looking to fit a double shot in one cup it was too small and spilled but super cute to have use and the glass is thick and handle is very sturt,20

positive,"Replaced worn out valve on Maytag Neptune.  It pays to verify the serial number as the series is identified in that number.  This one took the smaller valve and it was a very easy installation.  It took less than 20 minutes to remove and install.  Recommend that you identify each connector so you can replace them in their correct position.<br />Valve came in a bubble pack and the valve itself appeared to have partial piece of tape on the two water inlets.  This was a new valve and didn't expect this.  Anyway, the washer is now working and that's the important issue.  Great value.",20

For all you environmentalist enthusiastic people, the best part you can add this to your compose. Filter and all.",20
positive,This product works very well. Glad we got it. We are avid tea drinkers.,20
positive,"The exhaust fan works really well! I can‚Äôt find anything that I don‚Äôt like about it. It has very nice features and appearance. I love the fans gesture control, no need to touch the controls while cooking so it keeps it nice and clean. I haven‚Äôt used the remote control yet but am sure it will be a bonus. The noise level isn‚Äôt bad. The suction is very strong. I cook a lot and notice that I haven‚Äôt had to go past the 2nd power level to remove the cooking odor and smoke. I would definitely recommend this product. I have to mention that their customer service department was a pleasure to deal with which isn‚Äôt always the case in my experiences. They had a quick response time and resolved my issue with a complete replacement. The price was reasonable, I‚Äôm very happy with this quality product.",20

negative,"I wanted this to be good and comparable to the LG 600 filter, but after the kids tasted the water, they hated it and said it tasted weird. So I'm going back to the $50 filter!",20
negative,"I suspect the small plastic nodes aren't strong enough to hold the louvered door in place, since I've found it lying on the sidewalk outside my dryer two times. My next step is to use duct tape to keep the door intact while I buy a replacement. Unfortunately, my painter installed this one, then painted it match our house color -- so I'll need to redo that unless I want it to stay white. Don't recommend.",20
positive,I was looking for the filters in Amazon and I think this is the only right one that fits my exhaust fan.<br /><br />Hopefully it will last.,20
positive,Part came quickly and was just what I needed to get my washer going.  It was identical to the part I removed. Thanks!,20

positive,I was hesitant to buy appliance parts from someone other than the manufacturer. But this part is a direct OEM replacement and the appliance is back to working perfectly.,20
positive,Perfect for most dryers if you're not getting a flame. Much less expensive than going through your local parts dealer.,20
positive,The is as advertised. Work as expected in my Samsung fridge.,20
positive,These are great. The orange opens up the larger oz options for travel mugs. I use both all the time. Saves money. I use them in my purple K250 and I also bought them for my mom to use in the K350 I got her. Works in both with no issues and no clips or mods are needed.,20

negative,It worked great for the first week or so - was making ice non stop.<br /><br />But then it stopped making any ice at all.,20
negative,We really like these filters. I just ordered a box of 300 but received a box of 100 with a 300 sticker on it. Returned it and received the same thing again. I knew it was the wrong number because the box was a lot smaller than my prior purchases. Great product but make sure you are receiving the correct amount.,20
positive,"Fantastic dryer. I would definitely suggest it to anyone! & it‚Äôs beautiful. (I got the blue. Has gold trim around the door)<br />It does dry great. It is not noisy/loud. Not heavy. The door has a really strong magnet, and doesn‚Äôt pop open. And a very good purchase price.<br />Oh, and I haven‚Äôt noticed any difference in my elec bill. I use the dryer 1 day every week, for about 5-6 hours.<br /><br />But it‚Äôs not TOTALLY worth 5 stars‚Ä¶<br />To me, these are KINDA minor, as the dryer does work great.<br /><br />1) It takes a longg time to get hot. Once started, it‚Äôs roughly 30-40 mins be it‚Äôs actually hot enough to start drying.<br />On the high heat setting, without overfilling‚Ä¶ it pretty much takes the full 130mins it is set to, to fully dry everything. (And the timer cannot be changed, btw)<br /><br />2) The little power button light is annoying (to me, at least). It fades on & off constantly, like a 2 second cycle of each. It‚Äôs in my bedroom, so it‚Äôs super annoying. Lights up the room more than it seems like it would. (I think I‚Äôll just unplug it, and only plug it in when using)<br /><br />3) The vent hose does not stay on the back, and the little screw with it does nothing. I took some packing duck tape, and just used a few pieces to hold it on. Stays great now.<br /><br />4) The lint trap is really hard to clean. It‚Äôs kinda hard to take the whole thing apart. And the actual trap is a very, very thin piece of felt‚Ä¶ super hard to get lint off, and feels like it will tear easily.",20

positive,"Not noisy, good light distribution. Great product, especially for the price",20
negative,Not happy at all and I really wanted it to work.  If I get my issues resolved I will change my review but for now I received it yesterday.  There is a whole broken on the inside of the wash bin part and if its meant to be there it look very poorly cut out and if water goes into it I'm pretty sure it will get all over the electrical.  I don't know it just doesn't look right.  It leaks really bad from the drainage part and I checked the tube and its not broken.  I'm really upset and would like one that works. Please,20
positive,"Great product and it has made a big difference.  In the past, the filter would be growing something and have a funky smell.  This season, that didn't happen.",20

positive,"I bought this back in June or July, I moved into a travel trailer and was looking for alternate Way to do my laundry to keep me from going to the laundry mat. It is now November, and I have to say best purchase I could have made. Now keep in mind this isn't a high-tech big washer. I can't wash my bed comforter it's too big for it. I also only do my own laundry I'm not washing clothes for a big house.  The main complaint I would have on it is the pump to push the water out of the tank isn't very strong. So the side hose where the water drains out if you have that leftover something it won't drain out, it won't push the water out. My solution is to just lay the hose flat. Originally I wanted to be able to move it into my bathroom and drape the hose over the bathtub and have it drained out there but that was not a option. Instead I just keep the washer outside in a shed, or use the water hose to fill it up and to rinse the clothes off. The dryer ringer works better than I imagined it would, sometimes I might have an issue getting it balanced but as soon as I do the clothes will ring out fairly dry, do you keep in mind it's not a heating dryer so of course you're close will still be damp when they come out I just hang them on the line after that. I was worried after I first bought it I was playing with the timers end it stopped working. I thought I was gonna have to return it and get a new one or a different product, but I love the timer timeout unplugged it plugged it back in and then it started working again just fine, I haven't had any issues since then. Overall for the most part I am pleased only thing I would change on if I could is a stronger pump, but if you don't mind having it outside and just laying the hose flat he won't have much of a need for one.",20
positive,Item received was DA29-00020B for use in System DA97<br />Item needed was DA97-17376B as you can see.  anyway My Brother has a Fridge that this cartridge may fit so I'm giving it to him.,20
positive,Product as expected.,20
positive,"Installed this on a Saturday afternoon. Some of the instructions are a bit confusing. They appear to have been translated into English by a person not entirely familiar with American English or even the Queen's English. If one is familiar with working with gas appliances, it is not an issue. If you're not, and you plan on doing this yourself, take some time to check out some of the tutorials on gas stove installation available on the internet before starting.<br /><br />Stove comes with fittings for both LPG and natural gas as well as a spare set of jets. The brackets included to secure the top to the counter may not work for you. They didn't for me. My counter is too thick and had to make my own brackets.<br /><br />Overall, it is well constructed even though it isn't as sturdy out of the box as something like a Bosch. Once it is installed, that slightly flimsy impression goes away.<br /><br />I didn't have to adjust the new pressure regulator (included) after installation. It was set appropriately for my setup. You will need to provide gas rated PTFE tape to seal the connections. This is YELLOW Teflon tape. Don't use white Teflon tape. Check your seals with soapy water to ensure you have no leaks.<br /><br />This replaced a GE Profile gas cook top. So far, I've prepared two meals using this cook top. I'm very pleased with its performance. The large burner in the center handled my wok and I was able to whip up a stir fry easily.<br /><br />Other users have complained about difficulty getting the stove to ignite. Remember when you first assemble, and turn on the gas, there is air in the internal lines in the stove. Open the valves on all burners until you smell gas to purge the air from the system. Vent the room and then try and start. Mine fired right up.",20
positive,"Perfect solution to those wasteful pre-filled plastic Kups you can buy that end up in a landfill. Pop one into your preferred holder, fill with your favorite grinds and that‚Äôs it.

positive,couldnt find these locally but it was the exact replacement for my dryer,20

So I brew the coffee into this container and use the easy spout to pour into my travel mug. It‚Äôs shape and material make it easy to clean.,20

negative,I ordered this part only lasted six months so I ordered another one only lasted 6 month complete junk! Don't buy!!!!,20
negative,This little machine is so freaking loud and knocks around. I have it on a flat surface in my laundry room and when I say it's loud it sound like it's going to take off from the helipad. So of course I immediately unplugged It for fear it would explode while in use. I know it is compact so I only put a few items of my 5 year olds in it to test it out. I wish I had a better experience and it's my first time using it right out of the packaging. Kinda a waste of money üôÑ,20
positive,"Great quality , fit and price",20
positive,This little thing is awesome! Cleans very well and is very easy to move around. Hooked right up to the bathroom faucet. My on complaint is if you have to drain back into the sink the drainage tube will certainly pop out and begin to drain onto the floor since there is not a good way to secure it. A little 3d printing and some thought and I now bracket to couple the drainage tube to the supply line. Homelabs should ship something similar with this washer as this is not a fun surprise!,20

This product is the DA29-00003G, which claims to replace the DA29-00003B, and while I was able to make it work, it required cutting away a small portion of one of the plastic tabs that help lock it in place.  You may have the same issue too, which is odd since the maker of this filter is the maker of the filtration system in the refrigerator.",20

positive,"The Whirpool stacking kit consists of two metal brackets and four plastic feet.  This kit is half the price of the official brand.  Works fine for stacking the units.  Comparing to the kit in the hardware store this is similar, but the brackets have a little different finish. Packaging was pretty generic and include a photocopy of the official whirlpool instructions. Differences are minor, and for $20 or so savings this does the trick.",20
negative,product although nice on the eyes does not match the measurements provided for the larger size pan. It does not fit the range.,20
positive,works great!  And at a great price!,20
positive,Does its job.  High quality,20
positive,These parts looked to be of high quality. Bearings spun freely yet were not loose. The other parts looked just like the factory parts as well. I bought this kit because the bearings on one of the factory idlers had seized up and the wheel broke free of bearing. The dryer still worked but thumped when the drum rotated. The factory belt and tensioner were fine but I replaced them anyway with the new parts. I've had no problems with these parts and expect them to last a long time. The factory parts were about 14 years old and saw use every day in my LG front load dryer. delivery was fast. Price was very reasonable. I recommend this product.,20
positive,"as some folks have noted, this is a nice manual no-electricity method to take care of handwashing clothes if a washer is dead or otherwise out of reach. the footprint is small. the bag folds nicely, the plunger stick can be disassembled from its head, the side screw-on valve for water to exit is a great touch on what otherwise appears to be a fold-down dry bag that is coated and otherwise hopefully reasonably heavy-duty. running through a couple rounds with this gadget, i've found that while it may do the trick for lighter-duty items -- spring or summer clothes, light fabrics, quick dry types -- for heavier items such as towels or blankets, it doesn't work quite as well. or perhaps it would but not without extended effort plunging and longer waiting times and the like. heavier fabrics take more work to penetrate. there's a reason why washers usually have reasonably high-powered motors. to assume that using this gadget requires no manual effort is to delude yourself. it's a moderate amount of effort to do some extended plunging, to manually wring out the bag between washes/rinses, and also to manually wring out clothing items afterwards to finish out the process. it makes you appreciate how much less work you do by letting a washer do its thing. but in its absence -- say, during travel, or without access to a washer -- this will certainly be a low-footprint alternative. 4 stars because of the price. while i imagine you could stuff queen-sized sheets, or a thinner queen-sized blanket into this to wash, i think you'd also be giving yourself no less than at least 20 minutes of work -- plunging, rinsing, wringing, repeat -- so consider the cost of labor if that's where you're headed.",20
negative,"I bought this filter. For a while, it worked just fine.  I drink coffee at least 342 days out of the year.  I have had this product approximately four years. About seven months ago, it stopped working. The water for one fill took about ten minutes to flow through. In other words, it is stopped up. I guess I thought it would last at least for ten years. The name of my product is ARROSTITI. Otherwise, it is the same product.",20
positive,Good buy. Everything fit.,20
positive,Super,20
positive,So far so good. Makes ice real well even in warmer temps. The silver outside does not collect finger prints and is easily wiped clean with a damp cloth. It's small enough to fit under the kitchen cabinet. And light light enough to take and use if needed away from home. Works well on house hold electricity and plugged into a generator or solar generator that is capable of handling the load.,20
positive,It does as described.,20
positive,Works great. You need to make sure to use medium grind. Anything finer will not work.,20
positive,A bit more expensive but *much* higher quality than box shop plastic versions. I replaced all of the vent exhausts in our home with this wall cap. It's hard to get too excited about a wall cap but am very happy with the quality and appearance.,20
positive,Slightly less depth then original. Better then buying new washet. 4star on value would like to see under 100$,20

positive,"I love this little guy. It's the perfect single serve frothing pitcher and so cute in size, but yes it is tiny. I'm the only one using it; so for my 8 oz lattes or macchiatos I do 4oz of espresso and then 4oz of milk, frothed. I love the measuring lines in the pitcher too and they are accurate, I've checked with my Pyrex measuring cups and and 8 oz espresso cups.<br />When I froth the 4 oz it just about doubles in size and frankly you can't froth much more than 4oz in this without it coming over the edge. Depending on your milk and how frothed you wanted it, you could push 6 oz. I also use this for making espuma/ espumita which if for nothing else you should try.<br />Because it was cheap but also stainless steel, I decided to put it directly on my stove to heat and it was just fine on low heat. Whether you do that or not is your own perogative, since it's not recommended by the manufacturer. But I do it every morning and have no issues, I love it, perfect single serve.",20
negative,"I haven‚Äôt used it yet, but my review is on my experience so far.  I love the size.  It‚Äôs perfect for an apartment.  However, the instructions are HORRIBLE.  I have no idea how to work this after reading them.  I tried searching videos, but they are all for different portable washers.  Also, the power cord is pretty short.  I don‚Äôt know if I can use an extension cord.  Lastly, the description says it has a built in drain pump, but that‚Äôs not true.  I hope my experience improves after I figure out how to use it because right now I‚Äôm not very happy and am only keeping it because my dirty laundry is building up while I‚Äôm in quarantine.",20

So once we removed the broken piece the new filter easily connected.<br /><br />Does not fit our Samsung fridge. Major difference in size at the top. Picture included. Also it's a bit longer than our previous filter.,20
positive,"I am very impressed with this counter top ice maker. It took awhile the first I made ice. Some of the other reviews said the ice was watery, but I did not experience this. The ice was solid, however I‚Äôm sure it would have melted had I left it in the ice tray very long. I filled the tray a couple of times and put the cubes in an ice container and kept it in the freezer.",20

Just for kicks I went to Amazon to see if they had replacement knobs and was surprised that they did. So I offered them. Got them in 2 days.  Super happy with them and would recommend them to others.  This vendor stated a new improved model which is what i was looking for, as I didn‚Äôt want to repeat replacing them again down the road.

negative,"I did NOT buy this for the unit.  I bought them because the 'W' washer was what I wanted and needed for another brand.  And the washer was exactly the same (nice that they had a ruler next to the cap, I could see that the washer would fit my unit.)  Saved me lots of $$ over having to buy the whole replacement from the OEM.  (I think the washers are really universal, but you cannot find them in any local hardware store.)",20

negative,"The kit was advertised to include the drive belt, however it was not included.",20
positive,This replacement part fit my washer and works great. Our water pump went out. We received a quote for a repair that was more than the cost of a new washer. Using tutorial videos we replaced the broken pump with this one in less than an hour. Our washer has been working good as new! We have only had this part for a little over 1 month.,20
positive,"I'm only a week into the recommended one month use for the water filter disk that came with my Mr. Coffee coffee maker so I won't be using one of new twelve disks just yet.  Although this is a preliminary review, I'll give the product the benefit of any doubt and start off with a 5 out of 5.<br /><br />The twelve water filter disks came loose but individually packaged, all in a study shipping envelope.  They fit the Mr. Coffee provided filter disk holder with no problem.  The filter disk material is darker in color (as in a dark charcoal grey) vice the light grey of the filter disk that came with my machine and the filter material is a bit stiffer than the more pliant material in the OEM filter but I don't know why that would affect the filtering capability.<br /><br />I'll update the review in a few weeks if there are any problems.",20
positive,"As another review mentioned, people are probably using these for the job and then sending them back.  I received a clearly used (it was dirty) tool.

positive,[[VIDEOID:70ae96d77a32657574968269153b5f50]] I have zero complaints about this machine.  It‚Äôs small for in my small bathroom and able to wash clothes.  In small portions but it gets the job done.  Don‚Äôt put full-size comforter in it. You may get it to wash but it will not spin dry it. It‚Äôs to heavy. Anything twin size it can do but if the blanket is very heavy don‚Äôt wash nothing else.  You have to understand this is not the size of a regular washer machine. I‚Äôve washed 3 sweatpants 3 sweatshirts underwear and socks at the same time. I can wash even more when it comes to my kids clothes.  I wash twin sheets and towels and even my dogs bed. It‚Äôs very powerful and never had to rewatch anything.  The features are great.  You get to control the timing of the wash. How many times you want it washed rinsed and spin. There is no soap dispenser so you have to put it in when you see the water filling for both wash and rinse cycle. But just hit the pause button before lifting the door. I use the rapid wash a lot which is 19 minutes for minor washes. And it‚Äôs great.,20
negative,"Bought this unit last year for our RV; sounded like a good unit, and less than what the RV dealer sells.  To get cloths dry, you can really only use 1/2 of the washer capacity.  The fan barely moves the vented air out, so we bought an in-line fan; still didn't help much with the drying.  We now have three function failures, all relating to the drying function, so all we can do is wash.  Had to buy a small dryer to sit on top of washer.  We could have purchased a separate washer and dryer for half the cost and not had these issues.",20

positive,What a rack,20
positive,Simple. Work great.,20
positive,I researched all reviews and this one won! I‚Äôm so happy I chose it because it is exactly what we needed.  When I followed the instructions on first set up within 5 minutes it started making the ice. We drink a lot of water so I have a large Pur water filter system that I use to fill a pitcher and keep in the refrigerator. I used this water and I believe that it is cold when I put into the ice machine helps for faster production of ice. I have bagged so much ice and keep in freezer that my kids use it instead of our ice maker which is larger half moon cubes. The ice last so much longer in a drink than our freezer ice. It is very low noise which was an issue for me that now I‚Äôm so use to it I know when it stops and I need to move the ice so the full light will go off or I need to add water. Very compact size. I can‚Äôt say enough good about it and have no complaints at all. Been running it everyday for 2 weeks and it hasn‚Äôt changed at all.<br />I would definitely buy another one if I could just because it is a great ice making machine!!!<br />You will not regret the purchase.,20

Exactly what we wanted!",20

The noise has continued to last longer and happens multiple times in a use.<br /><br />What prompted a review now 6 months into use, is the tiny specs of white plastic that is coming out of the ice. We believe the sound is grinding some plastic internally which is now in the product. It's become a ridiculous amount of white plastic specs in the ice.

Not a problem with ice maker but can be a problem storing the ice. Suggestion if not immediately using the ice - bag it in quart size bags for freezer storage. Two hits of the bag on counter breaks up the ice,20

I bought pods that go in other coffee makers (like Senseo) because of the price being so much cheaper.  I did not read the description thoroughly and realized that I did not buy K-cups but Pods instead.  When I received the pods, I partially opened up the pod and poured the coffee into my K-Cup reusable coffee filter.  It made good coffee and tasted just like the K-cup coffee.  It may be a little bit of trouble but well worth it for the price of the pods compared to K-cups.  I will probably not buy the pods again, but the filter is easing me through having to use the two boxes of pods up.

positive,Very easy buying experience. Product works as promised & looks great... Would strongly recommend ...,20
positive,"Didn‚Äôt fir my model exactly, even though it stated it would in advert, but after a bit of an adjustment, we got it to fit. It‚Äôs working great & savwd me an new range!!!",20

positive,I travel often for work and like to know how accurate the hotel room thermostat is.  This little thermometer is perfect to take with me.  I gave one to each of my daughters to use in their dorm room and apartment as well.  It's very small at only about 1.5 inches long. I tested them first and they are very accurate. This is a useful little gadget.,20
positive,I watched a video on youtube prior to ordering to see how to do it.  It's very easy and done in minutes.  A few screws and unplug the boards.  Replace with the new ones and you are done.  15 minutes from start to finish.  Started making ice right away.,20
positive,Works as intended.,20
positive,"I have owned rhis stove since 2003 and have purchased at least 10 or more sets of drip pans locally. None of them fit correctly. They caused me to break the burner trying to get them to fit.  Finally the burners were so bad I could hardly keep a pan on the burner. They kept wanting to slide off. I had to get new burners which costme $250.00 from a local dealer who ordered them on line. After I had paid for them, I got on line myself and saw that I could have purchased them for much less.  I also thought we were getting the pans along with the burners but didn't.  The dealer had a no return policy.  If I ever need anything else for this stove, believe me, I will order them from this site. The pans are great.",20
positive,This was really easy to install and a perfect replacement for the old broken one on my dishwasher.,20
positive,Easy to install - follow the directions,20
positive,Works great! 10 minute install!,20
positive,"I bought this because we have a stand alone freezer in our basement.  We had an instance where the door was somehow not closed all the way and we lost a lot of food.  I had been searching for a device to ""alarm"" us if the temperature dropped in the future.  I'm an old guy and did have a couple of snags in initial setup, totally my inability to""read"" directions.  I attribute that to being a man!  Thankfully the support I received from YoLink was the best support I have ever received for anything I have ever bought.  Thanks to the guys at YoLink, I have an up and running unit connected to Alexa as well!  Thank you!",20
positive,I love my ice machine,20
positive,The filters allow for the perfect cup of coffee! Never rip or tear through the 300 I have used!,20
positive,Thank you!!,20
positive,I‚Äôve had a few portable ice makers that have broken. This one is holding up well so far and everyone in the family likes the style and taste of the ice it produces. Very easy to set up and feed.,20
negative,"It did not fit my klean kanteen coffee mug without being extremely wobbly, which is pretty scary when you are pouring nearly boiling water.  But the seller excepted my return with no problem.",20
positive,Perfect,20
negative,"I replaced the filter in my Kenmore fridge in April 2019 with a Purelli brand and ordered a pair of (much cheaper) Water Drop replacements to be used next time.<br />These were supposed to fit my fridge (Kenmore model #106.50269993) but when I tried to install a new one today (11/30/19) it would not seat. Upon closer inspection, the tip that must engage within the receiver is slightly different from the (functional) one that I was removing. The knob would not turn to secure the Water Drop filter, so I had to remove it and use the old Purelli  till I can order a new one. Unfortunately, the Amazon return window has expired so I'm stuck with a $28 mistake.",20
positive,So far it's working very well. It appears to be at least as good as the lg brand.,20
positive,and it came with two!,20
positive,The water filter was recommended for my model LG french door refrigerator. It is the same filter that came installed from the factory. I am pleased.,20
positive,Perfect size for making Matcha.  Love this,20
negative,I've ordered this product before and it is GREAT. But - wow - what is up with putting a shipping label on the actual product box???,20
positive,Used on GE fridge GTS18ABSARWW..,20
positive,Works perfectly,20
positive,Exactly as the original.,20
negative,"UPDATE 12/21.  Unfortunately, our unit stopped making ice in less than 3 months. Based on my previous review, we read and followed the manufacturer's directions, along with other user's feedback.  We used the ice machine less than 3x and since then, it was properly stored on a level surface in our pantry.  Just yesterday, we needed ice and took the unit out of its hibernation.  The unit tries to make the ice but it looks like it is not cold enough to freeze the water?  We contacted the manufacturer and they instructed us to reset the unit. This entails a long-press for the On/Off switch to activate the cleaning mode.  You will see all the lights to start blinking in sequence.  The unit ran through its cleaning mode.  After this process, the unit still does not make ice. Very disappointing.  I am reducing the 5-star to 1-star.  In less than a few weeks, the unit does not work. We will see if the manufacturer honors their warranty.<br /><br />*<br />The ice maker arrived and we followed the directions and followed advice from other users.  After unboxing the unit, we let it sit for 2 hours (very important) before we started the ice maker.  After the initial setup, the unit was making ice!  It wasn't too loud and the ice was a bit on the wet side.  Otherwise, the machine did what we wanted it to do... make ice.  Make sure you keep an eye on it every hour or so. This will make sure you empty the ice tray and keep the water at a reasonable amount (you don't want the machine to run out of water while it it is turned ""On"" as others reported that it can burn out the motor.  TIP 1:  When you empty the ice tray, put the ice in a zip lock bag and put it in the freezer. This allows you to break-up the ice once it clumps together after freezing; TIP 2: Don't use tap water; TIP 3:  After use, drain out the water and use a clean towel to dry inside; TIP 4:  this is an ice maker and not a freezer. Empty the ice tray in a zip lock bag and freeze it. This will allow to break-up the ice once they clump together.<br /><br />We'll continue to enjoy the ice maker and update this review in a few months.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Solid build<br />Stainless steel finish<br />Makes ice at a perfect size<br />Low noise<br /><br />Cons:<br />Durability (not sure how long the unit will last)<br />Must wait 2 hours after you unbox before use<br />Must wait 30 mins after you move/relocate the unit before use<br />Ice comes out a bit wet<br />Unit non-insulated",20
positive,This product is a fraction of the price of the GE brand and is literally the same product. Works great in our refrigerator and the water tastes great. I will definitely buy this again.,20
positive,work well.,20
positive,"Just like the manufacturer product, but much cheaper and works and the water tastes great.",20
positive,"Product was delivered on time and was as stated. Was just installed today, so can't give accurate rating of durability.",20
positive,Perfect replacement part for our Kitchenaid dishwasher.  Found a video online and replaced it myself in 30 minutes.  Easy peasy!,20
positive,Product was a exact match for my kenmore dryer hopefully it will last another ten years now,20
positive,"They're bright, and economical. We put them in the underneath of the over-range microwave. They've got a slight flicker to them, but not so bad that they're unbearable to cook by.",20
positive,Fit and easy to install,20
positive,Not sure that ‚Äúsheerness‚Äù applies to this dishwasher drain pump but I can say that the part came quickly and my husband was able to easily install it - according to him the part has been re-designed in a sturdier way - so hoping to get years more out of our dishwasher!  Also able to purchase through This vendor/Amazon at a much more reasonable price too!  Very satisfied!,20
positive,"Easy to install, fit and cable length were the same as the unit I replaced.",20
positive,Great price! Work and fit as expected. Very pleased. Good quality.,20
positive,Excellent quality and value. Will continue to buy.,20
positive,Used for my stove and it protect my stainless still on the edge.,20
positive,I didnt get the moisture sensor with this kit. Got all the rest. Dryer works great.,20
positive,Awesome product to have in your home if you are a specialty coffee/tea drinker. My husband purchased me this Christmas and i have used it almost every day since! The measurements on the inside of the mug make it very convenient to use and the handle is easy to hold.<br /><br />The cup fits perfectly under the frother for our De'Longhi Espresso and Cappuccino Maker. (which says a lot. see attached espresso maker below)<br /><br />https://www.amazon.com/DeLonghi-EC155-Espresso-Cappuccino-Maker/dp/B000F49XXG<br /><br />Overall we Highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a good frothing mug! Even our pup approves!,20
negative,Screws didn't really work right.,20
positive,This fits my model as it should.,20
positive,"Arrived quick and I am very pleased with the product. Filters are thick. Unlike another company's that I ordered from previously. Good price, too. Now I know who to reorder from.",20
positive,Looks and works the same as original.,20
positive,"This is an awesome machine. It is very quiet, has a powerful spin while washing and or draining, it is well build and has a lot of future for the amazing low price. Highly recommended for anyone who does not have a full size laundry hook up in their home/apartment. Amazingly you can also load lots of laundry and the setup was fairly easy. We do recommend a washer dolly for this unit as it has no wheels on it. Happy washing all!!",20
positive,Cheap and good,20
positive,"Great filter , quick arrival upon order.",20
positive,"Lots of good YT videos to help the disassembly and analysis.<br />If your ignitor resistance reads ""open circuit"" this will fix it.<br />Five minutes to install once you get the dryer front removed.<br />This part is priced 10X higher at some sources, so shop carefully.",20
positive,"worked, but it's more expensive than the other one I use to get. The seller sold out of it and this is the only one I can get on Amazon with good reviews.",20
positive,Part arrived quickly and worked perfectly.,20
positive,Great price and fast shipping,20
negative,The machine is not what I expected. Slow cook and touch screen kinda slow. Feel unsafe someway. Decide to return it.,20
negative,"Did not fit in my French door Samsung fridge. It said it was compatible but unfortunately was not. Returned it, no hassle.",20
positive,I've had this ice maker for my business for over a year now with absolutely no problems at all. Ice makers are generally not very reliable because there are so many moving parts in freezing temptress but Hoshizaki products are so well-made and designed. I have a friend who used to work for Tacobell and he said Hoshizaki was the only brand they used for the stores because they are just the best. So spend the extra money and buy the best! You won't regret it!,20
positive,Used it for intended use,20
positive,It seems to be working good so far. The ice cubes are a small size which I like. My son in law put it in for me and said it wasn't that hard to put in.The only thing I can think of that was a con was it took about 5 full days to get it full of ice. I waited till it was full before using it. So far I've had  2 weeks and I would say I recommend it but I'd to use it and give it a little more time before I do that. So I will review again in a couple weeks,20
positive,Thought my washing machine was dead.  in 15 minutes it was up and working again.  Made my wife think that maybe I was worth keeping around.,20
negative,"The ice maker seems well constructed and pleasing to the eye.  The ice that it makes has a lot to be desired.  The ice cubes are soaking wet, and never fully freeze like the ice that our home freezer produces.  I wanted a bunch of ice for a beverage container for an event at the house.  Once the ice was produced, I put it into a freezer to build up the amount of ice we needed.  Since the ice is very wet, it froze into a big ice block in the freezer, which I had to break up with an ice pick.  I re-read the instructions, and tried the suggestions that instructions referenced, but no change.  What a pain the the butt.  I planned on returning the ice maker but found that I had already gotten rid of the box and packing material, so I didn't return it.  This is headed to Goodwill.  Very disappointed.",20
positive,Worked like a charm - washer that wouldn‚Äôt drain now works like new. Good OEM,20
positive,"I was shocked to see the poor reviews on this microwave.  We bought a house over three years ago that had this microwave installed already (and we are the second homeowner). We have never had a problem with it.  It has been perfect.  Always works, always heats and have never once called for service. Sorry to hear so many other reviewers had such a bad experience.",20
negative,Way to expensive. Research how to hack the filter. It takes about 10 minutes and the generic filters are only $15...,20
positive,I've been using these for several years and they are of exceptional quality. Sized perfectly for the coffee pod used to brew a single cup. The coffee has non of the bitter oil you get when not using a filter. I highly recommend these,20
positive,Seriously worth the buy.<br /><br />I live in a place where it has really bad hard water and it leaves a film on everything no matter how much you need boil your own dishes to get them clean<br /><br />This fit pretty much almost on a kitchen roll round cart with a larger top adaption.<br /><br />That way I can roll it out of my way do the fact that the cabinets hang a little too low for me to stick it on a counter.<br /><br />Please measure before you purchase it to make sure you're okay with how big it might be to place on a counter and or you might need like a roll around cart.<br /><br />I love it.<br /><br />I haven't lived in a place with the dishwasher that was accessible to me in 12 years.<br /><br />The water in other places wasn't as bad to the point that I could boil my dishes to get them completely squeaky clean.<br /><br />This was easy to hook up. It's easy to unhook.<br /><br />Be careful with the hose when you're moving it around away from your sink because it will drain all over your floor. So please keep a town nearby and be prepared to possibly dry up your floor. I usually put my draining hose and make sure it gets emptied out pretty good as much as I can and leave it kind of hanging in my dish drainer that's on my counter.<br /><br />But I've had a roll around portable washing machine that was the old fashioned one.<br /><br />I like the size of this one I like the belly I can move it completely out of my way and it doesn't take a whole lot of space because it's on a cart that I can use the space underneath.<br /><br />My guy even bought one for his place because he didn't have a dishwasher and actually it installed it into his lower counter space.<br /><br />It is got the majority of my stuff pretty sanitized and very clean.<br /><br />Again dishwashers are made to basically sanitize your dishes make sure you really kind of get all the hard stuff off of your dishes first. It works great but it's not a replacement for stuck on food particles on your dishes. No dishwasher is.<br /><br />To me it's convenient.<br /><br />Again I love it.<br /><br />It's exactly what I expected.<br /><br />When I don't need any more it's going to some deserving home for free.,20
negative,"The moister sensor is a little too sensitive for us. We live in the Pacific Northwest with household humidity around 70%. I had to take the face plate off to get at the holes that allow you insert a little enclosed tool to open the lid on the control settings. At first I thought there were no holes so I almost wrecked it using a knife to pry open the settings cover. I'll try lowering the sensor all the way and see if that helps, but it's almost all the way down already...ALSO, the ground wire seems oddly placed so that it didn't fit properly into the electrical box. That caused the face plate to not fit flush on the wall. Had to gouge out a notch in the electrical box to almost get it flush. That was a drag and it's still not perfect.",20
positive,"Easy to install, works. Turns out it wasn‚Äôt my problem, I had to replace the control board.. but figured I‚Äôd leave it in since the old one would probably fail soon anyway.",20
positive,These work great for refilling our own coffee and teas inside.<br />We love it along with our new drawer we can make them ahead and save money,20
positive,I only needed the refrigerator handle but for the prices I can‚Äôt complain.,20
positive,nice,20
positive,Perfect fit.,20
positive,We had another icemaker that worked great for a long while but it had to always be refilled.  The built in waterline is a game changer!  Amazing,20
positive,Good value for money,20
positive,Love these but you usually only get a few in a package.  There were 50 in this package.,20
positive,Works great in my Kenmore Elite and I will definitely be buying this again since the price is so much better than the original Kenmore water filter.,20
positive,Love that it‚Äôs clear and will hold 2 dozen eggs.,20
negative,"Ordered exact replacement filter unit when the warning light 'replace' came on.  Read and look carefully at the instruction diagram how to install the replacement unit.  It was a simple push forward to install the unit, tried it twice it did not work, tried it a third time, there is no way you can install the unit wrong side up, push the unit 'harder' did not work, re read the diagram again, nothing, inspected the replacement unit closely, the two prongs has a protective plastic cap/sleeve which I did not recognized, untill I looked at the old unit.  It would have been helpfull, if the install instruction states:  to remove the plastic sleeves before installing the unit.",20
positive,"This was just what I needed to fix ice maker in 3 year old Whirlpool . Was easy to install . Not sure what happen to the old but I see a lot of photos of the same thing , tray gets hung up",20

positive,Good value delivered fast,20
positive,worked great,20
positive,As advertised,20
positive,"If parts of the top rack of your dishwasher have broken and you are looking for replacements, know that they are sold separately and this piece is what holds it all together. I was surprised to see it is only a single piece so plan ahead if you will be needing them for both sides. Luckily it fits my Kenmore dishwasher perfectly and makes it so the other replacement parts I also purchased from Amazon work. It would be nice if it was all sold together so it wasn't so difficult to track down all the needed parts.",20
negative,"I‚Äôm an infrequent Amazon customer and disappointed with my purchase.<br />Two cartridges came in a brown box. I pulled one out, removed the sealed wrapper & installed. When I remove 2nd cartridge from box to put away, the sealed wrapper is cut away from top. Obviously,  this cartridge was returned or has been used. I‚Äôll find out in six months when I need it.",20
positive,Direct fit and works as it should.,20
positive,Works great!,20
positive,,20
negative,"it is hard to install by yourself. i can attach a magnet on it, that tells me it is made from cheap and low end stainless steel. but for the price, it is ok.",20
positive,"This product absolutely does what it says it does. The only issues I've had with it, is the size and the drying. The size can't fit an average size plate. I found that a little disappointing,. but I made do. There was one thing that was a design flaw, that is how it dries things. It doesn't seem to fully dry inside. Like if you don't open the door, it will stay damp until you pull out the dishes and dry them off yourself.<br /><br />Also, a side note, the fan vibrates the right side panel. A piece of tape will stop the noise.",20
positive,Worked and fit perfectly. Really made the water taste great.,20
positive,üëçüèΩ,20
positive,"Delivery was fast, very easy to install and very good price!!!",20
positive,"all good, wish it came in black with same sizes.",20
negative,"As others have mentioned, this part is identical to the original, which has a design flaw that causes it to crack fairly quickly (usually within one to two years; there are lots of on-line reports of this, and even a petition for recall on change.com).  Reviewer &#34;Pug Luver&#34; mentioned her workaround, which hopefully works well, although I worry that in the long term a washer may not fully prevent further cracking.<br /><br />LG actually has a very similar knob for other ranges (AEZ72909002) that is better designed, but they sabotaged the ability to use it as a replacement for the LRG 30355/30357 series by reversing the D-shaped connection hole.<br /><br />If you're stuck with this gas range (which likely means you'll run into the broken knob issue), my advice is to try the product from the LGknob web site.<br /><br />Needless to say, I'm telling anyone mentioning the need for a new cooking range to stay away from LG.",20
positive,If you‚Äôre looking for a recirculating air range hood look no further‚Ä¶this is it.  It‚Äôs well made and looks fantastic over my new 30‚Äù Whirlpool range.  I‚Äôm very happy with this product.,20
positive,"No issues, arrived timely",20
positive,Easily set up and programmed. Works perfectly. Stays within 2 degrees of the setting and the reading on the separate thermometer probe. I was using an ExoTerra thermostat and was having issues keeping the warm spot at a constant temp. The temps would range 10-15 degrees difference from the thermostat to the thermometer. The ZooMed is exactly what I was needing. Worth every penny.,20
positive,"Installed easily. Beware of sticking burner screws. They may break. Consider a shot of WD-40 / penetrating oil, hrs. or days before trying to disassemble.",20
positive,"Please note that this is a ""replacement"" not an OEM part.  That said it fit in perfectly, the capillary tube was about an inch longer than the old one but that doesn't really cause an issue.  The fridge is functioning properly and at $30 less than OEM, I'll take it!",20
positive,"This was a oven door seal. After the old one was removed, which took a little while, the new seal fit perfectly and was easy to install.",20
negative,"I bought this coffee maker after I had read negative reviews about Keurigs breaking down so quickly. Everyone in my family owns a Keurig and they have always worked great, but I still decided to buy a Cuisinart. From day one it was very loud when it brewed. Today, I got an EEO code. The only info given about it in the instruction manual is to call customer service. I am very frustrated. I had only brewed one box of coffee, 10 pods! Too late to call CS. I will have to wait until the morning to find out what is wrong.",20
positive,Was a perfect solution to fix an old stove.,20
negative,"It was such a great investment at first! It was making ice, I was using it, thought we had a good relationship, but then it went toxic on me. Took it about two months for it to stop working. I tried cleaning it, turning it off and on, sacrificed a chicken, nothing worked. I read the reviews but I thought I might be the one to change it. üíî",20
positive,I bought this because I needed it to fit INTO a four inch opening and it does - outside is a little under 4'' - I just threw out the one I previously bought somewhere else,20
positive,"Prompt shipping, exactly as described and fit well. Thanks",20
negative,"I ordered two of these to replace my current filters in my cloud humidifiers. I have had these filters before, so I know the cap typically cannot be removed and the filter is supposed to be filled with a material (likely carbon) to actually perform the filtering function. What I received is only the plastic case - no core. This will not do anything to filter the water of the humidifier.",20
negative,"Easy to install. However, I‚Äôve bought these three times and every time they fail after a few months. The last one failed after 2 weeks.  Pretty much a waste of money.",20
positive,Installed very quickly. As soon as I plugged it in the motor kicked on and started running. My old one as damaged by two power outages. This was a cheap alternative to replacing a four thousand dollar counter depth refrigerator. Great value and I could do it myself instead of hiring a professional to install it.,20
positive,Cheap solution to our issue.  Easy to tell if the dishes are clean or dirty so the kids don't put dirty dishes in with clean ones.  Good quality.,20
positive,Great,20
negative,Doesn't work any better than generics! Leaves muddy look at bottom of coffee we won't be using them,20
positive,Make sure this is the right filter for your refrigerator and it will fit right in and start working. A great replacement,20
positive,"It doesn't make ice quickly and the ice melts fast, but overall it serves it purpose",20
positive,This part arrived on time and was just as described. It went on pretty easily and my washing machine is working great.,20
positive,This was a perfect replacement on my side-by-side Kenmore Freezer which is a Frigidaire made at half the price of the OEM.,20
positive,Must have,20
positive,"This filter does cost more, but it fits and works.  I bought a 4 pack on eBay for $65.  Great deal?  Nope.  The filters look identical and are packaged identically to the real product, except for a sticker placed over the made in America printing.  I tried all four and all four wouldn‚Äôt seal because they wouldn‚Äôt twist on far enough!  They also had unwashed carbon and turned the water black.  I tried to flush the one that slightly leaked, but even after about 3 gallons the water was still black.  I put the old filter back in and everything was fine.  I ordered this ‚Äòreal‚Äô OEM one from amazon, installed it with no leaking and it‚Äôs just as it should be.  I did get a refund from the eBay merchant, but they didn‚Äôt want their filters back.  Dont waste your time with the $16 knockoffs!",20
positive,It works.  Enough said.,20
positive,Easy to install,20
negative,"This is a good product but the supplied attachment to the dryer and vent need mods. to work. Had to tape it down to get to stay secure, it kept falling off with the supplied attachments.",20
positive,"Better than buying one at a time, save money and time by buying in bulk.",20
positive,This is my second time purchasing these filters. They trap lint and fine cat hair very well. Durable. Have a Magic Chef dryer the fit is right on.,20
negative,"One out of every 3 breaks when used in a Keurig, so you end up having to double them up.  I don't think I would purchase these again.",20

positive,The works great and fast delivery.,20
negative,"I've had this installed for 6 months,  and it works less everytime I use it.  I love the lights, its not to noisy BUT It dosen't pull all the smoke/ odor out of kitchen. We have a big family & cook daily. So maybe perfect for a smaller , less used household.",20
negative,I returned the item chemical smell wouldn‚Äôt go away and penetrated into the clothes it did work well would have kept it if not for the smell,20
positive,Works great in the humidifier we run during the winter months in KS,20
positive,After 10 years my original clips both broke.  These were a direct fit for a Whirlpool dishwasher,20
positive,Works great,20
positive,So far so good.  They arrived as advertised and as expected.  I installed a filter as instructed and it worked as expected.  It is impossible to say other than it installed as it should and water flowed through it.  I should think a follow up review  should be requested at about the 5.5 month marker to test satisfaction during the entire advertised life cycle of the filter.,20
positive,Easy to use and clean. Contains coffee ground used in garden,20
negative,It does the job‚Ä¶ but the top keeps popping off every time I open it. Kinda annoying!,20
positive,Fit perfectly and the directions were easy to follow...will buy again,20
positive,great value and allows the machine to pushed back more with the 90' connectors,20
positive,"Good price, good delivery.",20
positive,I bought this machine 1.5 years ago and I love it. Machine is solid and quality construction. Truly worth every penny.,20
negative,"I previously purchased and have used two of these filters with good results. The new replacement filter I installed, received May 2017, causes the water to dispense extremely slow.

negative,No instructions  Not easy to use.  Good resource,20
positive,Estoy muy emocionada con mi lavadora es muy para lavar las ropas de los bebes.,20
positive,It's a good and handy product.. I liked it.. Good for frothing in single glasses.. But if you are frothing milk in a big vessel it does not froth properly.. But most of the times I use it for single cups only so works great for me,20
negative,purchased via local appliance store. Also purchased 5 -year warranty. VERY NOISY and has needed service 4 times in two years. GE service is a joke: slow with attitude. Poorly made and worse service.,20

positive,"This little coffee filter makes the best cup of coffee. Set it over your coffee mug. Pour the boiling water through it slowly, wait a minute, depending on how strong you like your coffee, you may have to adjust the time a bit to your liking.

negative,Didn't fit,20
positive,"This kit solved my problem which was that I wanted my washer and dryer's set up the way my hook ups were, dryer on the left, washer on the right. Now my doors open outward which means you can open both and just transfer from one to the other without using a basket and closing a door.",20

positive,Got the package a little early. No problems unpacking it. Had a little problem with the connector to the faucet. Didn‚Äôt understand about the threads inside of the connector. Finally figured it out. Washed 4 loads and flipping loved it!! My washer had some water in it. So thought cool at least I know it was tested! Finally figured out what the grate looking thing was for. Nobody really said just where it went. It is for the bottom of the unit. I am very happy with this bad boy!!!! No more fighting with nasty laundry machines any more!!!! Super easy to use!!!,20

I came across this one and decided to give ourselves an upgrade...omg I am so happy I did! We have so much more room, it is whisper quiet it doesn't get all icy in the back, and best part of all, it's an energy star so it's using wayyyy less energy than the smaller mini fridge was using!

positive,"I bought a house with a gas stove and a pretty good vented extractor fan above it, but the fan was too low and so it made cooking difficult. For example, it was very difficult to fish our paste from tall pots without hitting the utensil against the fan. So the goal was to replace it with a fan that was much more slimline. This one worked well because all the fan site up above and I had a slot where the vent was anyway that I could use.<br />The install went well and the unit held well via the supplied hardware. To make the unit really flush against the upper cupboards I used stainless steel screws in 4 places. I drilled pilot holes up into the steel and screwed through it to the wood above. This gave it a really pro look.<br />The fan itself works great and the LED lights are fantastic. They direct mostly to the front of the stove, but that's where you need them. My previous fan only lit the back.",20

negative,"I have a single-serve coffee machine which, while it accepts k-cups, is not a machine made by Keurig. This re-usable K-cup does not fit my machine, which uses a small spike at the bottom of the K-cup holder to puncture the plastic bottom of disposable coffee pods. Since this re-usable K-cup is basically the same dimensions as an actual K-cup, getting it into the machine runs the risk of puncturing the bottom and ruining it. Fortunately when I tried this, the spike hit the plastic cross section and not the screen/mesh filter. It's not usable though, and popping it into other non-Keurig single-serve brewers could be a risky affair. Look instead for one that's about half an inch or so shorter than a typical K-cup.",20

positive,"I purchased this for my Kenmore refrigerator as an exact fit.  Even as new, it kept popping out as soon as I wanted to dispense water.  I checked my water pressure and after reading several other blogs on the subject, concluded that a new filter holder base needed to be installed to make this work.  The ends of both the old and new unit look the same.  However, the new one would just not stay in place if you ran water through it from the water dispenser.  I ordered and installed a new filter base and my pop-out problem was eliminated.  My refrigerator is 9 years old.  If yours continues to pop out after installation and then pushing it in several times, you need to change out your filter base unfortunately.",20

I have tried everything from pour the water slowly to quickly and every variation in between.  Fortunately, I only use this at work and make one cup a day because it could not handle any more use than that.  I clean out the filter immediately and have put it through the dishwasher several times.  Wish it would work better because I like the concept.<br /><br />UPDATE - 3/15/2017 Willow and Everett Customer service is top notch.

positive,"I ordered the NuWave mini when I ordered my NuWave Pro since it was free and only paid $30 shipping through the manufacturer site. Initially, I was thinking it would be a good gift for someone since I now have the Pro....but....I'm liking the Mini more when it's just me at home cooking a quick dinner.<br /><br />First, I find the $90+ price to be way over the top. I'd find $39-$49 acceptable. Price isn't an indicator of quality, but an indicator of what you can/can't use it for. Funny enough you can buy the parts separately for ~$70.<br /><br />Secondly, make sure you keep the recommended cooking chart handy. I'm finding on average to add ~2 minutes per side to the cooking instructions. My first  frozen boneless skinless chicken thigh came out still pinkish in the middle. Adding 2 minutes more per side did the trick the next night.  The chicken was moist, done, and tasty.<br /><br />The electronic keypad seems durable and the timer is loud enough to be heard in another room. Good thing is, when the timer alerts, the NuWave turns off. No danger of overcooking this way.<br /><br />The dome seems to be sturdy enough, but I'm hoping if my dome cracks, it does so while in the first year.  If not, it's a measely $12 to replace.<br /><br />The rack can be flipped to get food closer to the heating element or further away by a margin of about an inch.  Not much difference.<br /><br />The Mini is is ideal for 1-2 people. I can fit two chicken pieces or two medium steaks, or two fish fillets. On the cooking videos, Chef Jennifer fills in around the meat with veggies. I would eat more veggies than can fit on the rack with 2 pieces of meat. Thus, why it's a mini.  But it cooks them well with a little adjustment on cooking times. I always start frozen and it cooks very well.<br /><br />The variety of foods you can cook in the Mini is only limited by the size of the food. If it's just me cooking for me, I can fit a piece of meat and veggies in and have dinner in about 15 to 20 minutes. Cleanup for the NuWave mini is SO EASY. While it's dishwasher safe (top rack for dome), I'll only hand wash it in the hopes of the dome lasting longer. It's easy enough so why not?<br /><br />Due to the Mini size, there aren't any official accessories to add to the NuWave mini but it does what it's designed to do very well. I think if the price dropped below $50 for this model, they would sell like hotcakes.<br /><br />A final plus to the NuWave brand is their excellent website where you can find replacement parts for this model. With your purchase, you also get free access to the NuWave cooking club that has recipes, videos, and tips for how to use your NuWave. For a budding ManChef, this really helps give me ideas.<br /><br />Enjoy! I have. :)",20

positive,"This nifty device makes pour over coffee at home to rival any coffee shop in town.  I've tried several other styles which are larger, more plastic, and harder to clean, but this tops them all.  The hard plastic ring sits directly on virtually any cup or mug and keeps the hot coffee hot while brewing, so there's never a cold cup even after steeping for a few minutes.  I'm ordering another to take on travel.  Really great little invention.",20
negative,"I own this range in black and would not purchase it again. My main issue is with design. The glass in the oven door retained streaks after a few months - looks perpetually dirty because there's no way to get at the streaks and remove them. At the base of the oven door is a fold of metal that comes up - it snags everything and you can't clean it, so it looks dirty as well. The metal drawer at the bottom has rough edges and I cut my fingers several times when I first got it, although I now have tape over those spots.<br /><br />Additionally, I'm losing color (my range is black) at the top, above the controls. I don't know why - I've only ever cleaned that area with a soapy sponge. But I definitely have white streaks among the black.<br /><br />In fairness, the performance has been OK, although it takes forever for the oven to heat. But I wouldn't buy it again, because you really can't make it look like it's clean.",20

positive,Filters were too big for my coffee pot and I cannot find plastic filters to fit the Keurig coffee pot that I bought so I could use the 1 lb of coffee that I wanted to use up.  I had a Keurig 2.0 which is what I wanted but could not find one when I was shopping so bought a different Keurig.  I wish I had waited until I found the coffee pot I want.,20
negative,"After the shaft on the original knobs fell apart, I decided to try these replacement knobs on my LRG3095ST range.<br /><br />Upon first look, the knobs are much more shiny than the brushed metal on the stove.  This makes them look a bit out of place at first, but eventually you get used to it.  The knobs are made of lightweight plastic and are weighted, but they still don't have the quality feel and heft of the original knobs.  That being said, they worked initially.<br /><br />Installing them was easy, but we noticed that all knobs are not built the same.  The knobs attach to the oven shaft at various depths.  One of the knobs attaches too close to the oven, leaving no room to push the knob in to light the burner, resulting in a burner that never gets used unless we swap the knobs.<br /><br />They lasted about a year until the knobs began to fail.  The small D-ring spring on one of them got pushed in so far during install that the knob no longer catches on the shaft and will spin freely.  Another has the D-ring in tact but its now mishapen into a circle, and this one spins freely as well.<br /><br />Even though the knobs have a metal cap on the shaft, they still largely prone to the same issue in the original knobs where the plastic surrounding the D-ring spring starts to break away.  It's just a poor design flaw that has been carried over to the aftermarket knockoff knobs.<br /><br />I'd love to get the original knobs and reinforce them so they are less prone to failure, but its hard to justify spending $40 for each OEM knob where you can get a 5-pack of these for less.  Not to mention that the OEM knobs are just so hard to find now as they've been discontinued, so you're pretty much stuck with this junk.<br /><br />Now that two of mine are already broken, I'll probably just buy another set of these and see if I can reinforce the knob in some way to get some more life out of them.",20
positive,Easy install,20
positive,"So far so good, meaning that I just got this machine today. I decided to just go first and get the 19 lb version. It was lighter than expected. Came shipped inside of a box that simply said panda and ezbyonline.com no notes about it being a washer. Turned it on made sure that the water would spin... not that this was a huge concern... but shipping damages areally the bane of my existence. I can say I expect good things from this washer. I have the original blue version which was great but I got tired of wringing clothes by hand. Anyway...posted a picture of the water at low level and of the back front knows and a picture next to my bathroom shelf to show height. I also took pictures of the spin tub and of the washer with a stick of deodorant for scale.<br /><br />Will post updated reviews when I get a chance.<br /><br />***Updates March 9th 2017****<br />LOOOOOOOVVVVVEEE my mini washing machine. Most of the shirts washed will be dry within an hour. Jeans can take 2-3 but are still quicker than the overnight dry required when hand washing. There is a lot of lint that can be left behind once the washing is done, although thats probably the hardest part and it only takes about 2 minutes to do. I do recommend leaving the tops open when done washing so that the remaining water can evaporate.",20

The description indicates first ice is as fast as 8 minutes and up to 24 lbs ice in 24 hours.  This is a true statement...but.  If you use the large setting first ice is in about 15 minuets and melts just about as fast as it's made.  It takes awhile and about 2 - 3 sets of ice to cool the interior enough to get usable ice.  We like to fill an 8 oz glass with ice before adding beverage, we've learned to give the ice maker an hour to achieve this.  After the first hour, each batch is good.  We usually will make ice for 2 hours, putting ice in the freezer in sealable plastic bags.  Next night do it all over again.",20

positive,"I am moving soon, and cannot take my full size washer and dryer with me. I had seen this product before, and thought it was a great invention. I have used a few times just to become familiar with it before the big move. Here are some key points- I think it is very effective for washing, I feel it cleans better than my actual washing machine. However, you will need to also purchase a product to spin your materials after washing, unless you want to ring out by hand. Second, as far as load size, I was able to wash full size sheets together for one bed that were microfiber material, but my son has T shirt deep pocket full size sheets, and I had to wash his flat sheet separately from top sheet, due to larger size. The largest item I have washed is a THIN full size blanket that stays on my bed, and it was a tight squeeze. I think anything over a ‚Äúfull size‚Äù blanket will be too much for this little device, but for our needs that is just fine. Also clothes worked great too, just keep in mind you will need to create smaller loads, vs. what a full size machine can handle. In my case, for two people, this meant cutting a normal load in half, for summer clothes.<br />I think this is a wonderful product, just keep in mind the points above to make sure it is also right for you.",20

negative,The pump is working well for a few loads and I don't see any leaks. But this one is definitely not OEM and has an extra flange on the electrical connector side that required a modification of the splash cover that fits over the motor.  I was still able to get it installed but I had to break off part of the cover (not part of this motor) that slides over the motor after it is installed.,20
positive,"I really like this dishwasher. It gives me the time left on a wash,  reminds me to fill the rinse, runs quietly, and does a great job.",20
positive,Worked perfectly!,20
positive,"The coffee is always better with the filter system, especially if you have hard water. The value for your money is very good too.",20
positive,The piece perfectly fit and works correctly for the broken part! And it was so easy to install I did it myself!,20
positive,Works perfectly,20
positive,It was the right heating element for my oven. Easy to install and very affordable.,20
positive,"I ordered the part on line and my husband thought he could install it, but then we decided to call our appliance repair person.  So even though we paid someone to install it, the total was still about half the price of ordering the part thru Sears.  Very happy with the ice maker!",20
positive,I had one of these in our old house and couldn't wait to get one for our new house.  So tired of hearing &#34;are the dishes clean or dirty&#34;.,20
positive,A cup of coffee,20
positive,"We are so happy with this item! It flips over to the same material on back, if you don't care to show the logo on the front. Definitely measure first because a half inch can make a big difference. We love it because we have very limited counter space and it helps! We make sandwiches and everything else on there. And it wipes off! So cool. Must-Have!",20
positive,This product was the perfect fit for the fridge.,20
positive,"I have used non OEM filters in the past and the water flow was really slow.  This filter works just as well as the OEM filter at less than one third the price.  Tasted water with the old OEM and new filter and there is no difference.  My tap water sometimes has an ""off"" taste.  The water tastes perfect with this filter.  It was simple to install in my Maytag frig.  I could not be happier!<br /><br />As with any filter, you need to run about a half a gallon to clear out the loose particles.  Once you do that you're good to go.",20
positive,"Helpful customer service<br />Very confusing manual, practically useless<br />Tiny little icons to work with, had to get my son to figure them out for me. Once that was done everything was easier.<br />Still needed expert to decipher E1 error message. Once that was done dishwasher works perfectly<br />29 minutes cleans and sterilizes then I air dry<br />PERFECT for small kitchen and for one or two people.",20
positive,These are perfect replacement filters. Just replaced the filter today. So easy. Better value than name brand!,20
positive,Good fit.  No after taste.  Have purchased twice and will again.,20
positive,Helps with the clean up of the reusable filter.,20
negative,I actually bought this thinking my old one was the problem but it wasnt. I left it on the washer anyways because I was too lazy to put the original back on.. not even a year later and this part went out. I put back on the original and my washer started working again.,20
positive,"worked very well, but I also had short vent route only needed 1 rod",20
negative,"Unfortunately, this product does not work with my samsung refrigerator model RF28HMELBSR, even though it is advertised as a replacement for the Samsung DA29-00020B. I tried several times to use this cartridge in the filter slot, it fits in, but the water does not go through and sounds like it is blocked or jammed. I would not recommend this product. Unfortunately, I had an original samsung filter that I used just after ordering this 3-pack, and that last for 6 months during which the return window for this product expired. I'm now stuck with these three filters.",20
negative,I purchased this product for my parents. The product is working as expected however when I was first researching I thought this was a genuine samsung product sold by another company. I should have paid closer attention to the title stating 'compatible'. If you're looking for a samsung branded product this item is not for you.<br /><br />I was considering returning it but my parents wanted a new filter immediately.,20
positive,It works really great,20
positive,Works as advertised. Would buy again.,20
positive,"Purchased for use in RV.  I can move it next to the sink for use and then disconnect to put in the wardrobe cabinet for storage.  A little bit of water does remain on the unit, so need to bring inside for the winter.",20
negative,These bags were too weak and tore when trash was compacted.  Do not buy these bags,20
positive,"These appear to be good hoses.  The woven metal sheath appears to be bright stainless steel.  The 90-degree connector at one end is very desirable, and probably mandatory for many washing machine installations.<br /><br />The hoses are shipped tightly wound, so they have a curl when unpacked.  As a result, plan to hang them up for a few days to relieve the curl before installing them.",20
positive,Easy fit into the original blower housing.,20
positive,PERFECT,20
positive,Good price. Works the same as brand name.,20
negative,"Cant beat the price , parts fit correctly , fixed my problem . Dont know how long they will last , but got rid of that terrible clanging noise. up date ,,, lasted three months and junk",20
negative,What I received was not at all the description or the picture so I can't really speak to how well it works because it wasn't the right product.,20
positive,"We ordered one and when it arrived it was defective. Started the return and they sent it almost as soon as I was done filling out the form. We received the new one and quite frankly, I‚Äôm in love. It works so well. It covered the price in little over 8 days.  Now when the ice melts in my cup my ice tastes like my water. (I am a super taster/smeller). I would recommend this ice maker. It‚Äôs easy to clean (white vinegar). It takes less than 10 hours to completely fill out freezer ice maker(that broke hence why we purchased this product), a 132oz jug, a 2 gal bowl and various cups and jugs 32oz to 64oz. We absolutely love the ice maker. Do follow your instructions!!!! Do not turn on right away. Let it sit like it says. The reason is bc of the compressor/coolant and shipping/handling. Definitely would buy again.",20
positive,SEEM TO WORK OK--A BIT EARLY TO COMMENT ON,20
positive,Nice material and perfect fit,20
positive,"This product is exactly what I‚Äôve been looking for. We have several coffee makers from Keurig to Ones from Brandsmart, to Nespresso. I really enjoyed the way the Nespresso worked so I was looking for an alternative to not needing to buy pods all the time and cater to the coffee I want to drink. I love this because it‚Äôs simple to use, simple to clean. I am giving it 5 stars, BUT it DOESN'T  make espresso style coffee. I think perhaps a smaller pod or version of this would be needed to make an espresso.",20
positive,Bought this as a gift for boyfriend. He loves it.  His step father tried it for the first time and said it tasted amazing compared to a regular cup.  Good for a single cup.,20
positive,Liked the price.,20
positive,Work just fine in my (slightly older) Keurig. They seem sturdy whereas otehr brands I've purchased fell apart very quickly.,20
negative,"- Great pricing for a 3-pack of OEM replacement cartridges.<br />- The first 2 cartridges did NOT appear to have lasted as long as I hoped.  This could be because of the minerals in our water, San Jose, but I had to replace the cartridges earlier than I had anticipated.<br />- We do drink a lot of water and use a lot of ice, but I thought (hoped) the cartridges would have lasted longer than the did.<br />- I don't believe any other brands would have done much better than these, so I'm price-driven at this point.",20
positive,"Back in October we ordered new water filters from Waterdrop through Amazon.  They arrived sooner than originally promised, with other items as well.  As always, Amazon was amazingly fast and incredibly accurate with this order, which contained a myriad of products and gift cards.  We installed the filters, as always they work great, and last a very long time.  We will definitely be reordering this product from Amazon when we need refills.  Great job as always!!<br />Thanks, Bruce & Barbara Reichel",20
positive,"We already recently purchased a GE dryer and have been very pleased, so when the washing machine tanked we started searching for a replacement. This unit has a great balance of automatic electronics and accompanying overrides for manual control. The many options for energy and water efficiency make washing the clothes a bit more fun. On top of the fun is the fact that the machine is really quiet... quieter than our clothes dryer! Great value and we highly recommend this model. Dennis in Oceanside, [...]",20
positive,Works well.  Exactly as pictured and delivered promptly.,20
positive,"Got this for our Travel Trailer (RV) over the summer.  I have to parked on private property just far enough from home and town that I am not driving for ice.  It's the first thing I turn on when I open up my Travel Trailer.<br /><br />I am surprised at how quickly it drops the first batch of ice.  Which is about enough for a drink.  The machine creates more then enough ice for my family of 3.  It great for the COVID alcoholic indigence moments.<br /><br />I had hopes of filling my giant cooler with it, but that's seems a little out of reach.  However, then my Terra Hiker Ice Maker's ice box gets full I dump it in my cooler and it gets me through a weekend despite our usage.  It probably work pretty well to initial fill a12 packcooler, but not one two people can share as a chair.<br /><br />The ice maker in my Samsung refrigerator keeps freeze up, so the Terra Hiker Ice Maker been sitting on the kitchen counter.  In an evening I can make enough ice for my drinks and fill my refrigerator ice box.  Which lasts about three days.<br /><br />In closing: I cannot compare the Terra Hiker Ice Maker to other machines because it's my first and I have not killed it yet.  I am very happy with it and glad I did not select a piece of junk.",20
positive,USE THEM ALL OF THE TIME.  BUY FROM AMAZON WHEN NEEDED.  ALWAYS HAVE ALWAYS WILL,20
negative,It took several hours just to make enough ice to fill the basket we had another tabletop ice maker and it made ice every 7 minutes this is not a good purchase,20
positive,"I had to split the first seam on the dryer gasket band, the way it was sewn would not allow the entire gasket the seat properly. After that I easily installed and glued the gasket in place. It has been successfully working for over a month.<br />Excellent repair method instead of replacing entire drum.",20
positive,"Pretty easy to install, just watch the YouTube videos. I had some trouble with the ice crushing teeth and I guess I didn‚Äôt install them correctly because the ice crushing feature doesn‚Äôt work. Oh well...üôÅ",20

positive,"I love my AeroPress. It is easy to use, consistent and great for travel. If you miss the perfect cup of coffee, buy the AeroPress.",20
positive,"Lovely product. We have been having issues with with the drum rollers, pulley, & belt on our Samsung dryer. Instead of calling a repair man & paying the home fee & service charge we've opted to fix ourselves. I had yet to find a complete set of parts. I would typically buy the belt & pulley for $30 on another site & drive to an appliance shop for the drum rollers which would cost $9 a piece. Having a kit that contains all the parts not only saves $ but valuable time. I will be purchasing this kit again if, heaven forbid, our dryer breaks again. Thank YOU!!",20
positive,"They stick to canning lids well, the go through the autoclave with no issues and as of yet I have not had one contamination issue due to a poorly made filter! I love these and will be adding more to my collection.",20
negative,It showed me numbers. The significance thereof was not certain.,20
positive,Used for a GE refrigerator - a perfect fit.,20
positive,Purchased so my son could also use ground coffee in his Keurig. He loves it and it saves him money.,20
positive,Perfect fit,20
positive,A+,20
positive,Very heavy duty and has the magnet strip installed. Very impressed with this seal especially because it was much less expensive than others,20

negative,It did not work for me.,20
positive,Highly recommend!! Product is better than original. Thank you so much for the Thank You card! It was nice to find a thank you from a small business. Highly recommend. Make sure you get the right part!!,20
positive,"Refreshing in more than one way is another way to describe these DA29-00020B replacement water filters. Refreshing first in that you can find a reasonably priced water filter that secondly is easy to install and that finally, these are those rare ones that leave your water with no odor or taste. The clear, clean and crisp taste is noticeable in both the water as well as the ice. While I have to admit I wasn't someone who always felt that changing the water filter in my refrigerator was something that made it to the top of my to-do list at least with any urgency that is with these replacement water filters they rate more than my to-do and in fact are a calendar event and one without an option to snooze.",20
positive,I use it at our place at the shore.  It works great.,20
positive,"Perfect factory replacement part for our dishwasher. It came without any instructions. Checking UTube for tips, I found several sites that had show and tell videos on how to install this part. The installation overall was easy and the part functions perfectly.",20
positive,Part works great and the price was fantastic.,20
positive,"When my washer lid lock seized up, I did a parts look-up and tried to find one with the same part number (DC34-00025A). Everyone was either out of stock, or was charging an obnoxious price for it. After some research I found this one is the new version. It is a little longer than the old one, though it fit perfectly in the space in the washer top, everything lined up and screwed in, and the cable was the right length to feed back through the wire locks and into the back of the control panel. I tested it a few times, and so far we have done quite a few loads of wash with no issues with the lid locking and unlocking.",20
negative,I'm pretty disappointed with the quality of this water valve. It makes a loud hissing sound when it opens to allow water in.,20
positive,Perfect fit for Cusinart dcc3000,20
positive,Works well and protects my new refrigerator. We'll see how long it lasts.,20
positive,It works,20
positive,Makes plenty of ice and works well,20
positive,Kenmore 70 series gas dryer.  Was leaving stains on clothes.  This seal fit.  Fixed!,20
negative,I tried using 1 filter on bottom of basket and coffee grounds were in coffee so I tried 1 filter on bottom and 2 filters on top to prevent grounds in coffee didn't work.  Our coffee had so many grounds you had to chew it!,20
positive,"This one fits quite well in the areas. So, that is 5 star, lets hope it wont get burn easily like our older one did about 6 months back. the price is also better than other one.",20
positive,"As noted in my star ratings, the product was great in those respects.  The only shortcoming is the wheels don‚Äôt roll as easy as the originals.  That may change as they get used.",20
positive,"I use these with a reuseable k-cup that I bought years ago. I think this really helps the process of the brew with the keurig and the &#34;do it yourself&#34; cups, before I needed to fill the entire inner container to get a consistent flavor. With these I just have to make sure I fully pack the little filter, which results in less coffee grounds needed (/wasted).",20
positive,Works great,20
positive,"Makes having a keurig machine so much more affordable, without constantly having to buy K-cups! Super easy to clean.",20
positive,Thank you just what I needed it.,20

negative,"You dummies! When you put text in describing what models it doesn‚Äôt fit, it shows up in the searches for those models.",20
positive,This is a perfect replacement for the original lint screen. It fits just right for my model. Been using it daily for a solid week and it does its job well. I‚Äôm very pleased with this item.,20
positive,It is the good kind with mesh on the bottom,20
positive,Perfect fit.,20
positive,They seem to work as well as the factory filters. I haven‚Äôt noticed a difference in taste.,20
positive,"I used this drain pump for my 15 yr old Whirlpool Duet HT front load washer.  This part isn't exactly the same as the OEM, but fit perfectly without any modifications and works like a champ.  Hopefully I can get another few years out of this great washer!",20
positive,"This is a backup part, not in service yet.",20
positive,"I was looking at filters. they all looked very similar. So I was confused that they all said type 4 cone. But some that said they fit my pot were almost double the price. I bought a new Ninja DualBrew Pro CFP301. Listing said it did not work with mine. So I tried it anyways. I noticed it was not fitting well. And other reviews on the plastic ones said it had to be jammed in there tightly. And after a use or 2 it actually fits due to heat forming it properly. So I inspected the machine NINJA for whatever reason made the basket area very slightly oval. So I tried sitting the filter on the counter on its side bale handle facing downwards. And pressing it down slightly till it was slightly oval. Now it works perfectly. Not sure if this will help anyone when they find it doesn't fit theirs. But it worked for us. Not sure why they made these ""type 4"" cone baskets perfectly round and didn't notice the shape issue. Good luck and cheers.",20
positive,The title says it all - it fits our Whirlpool fridge and the water tastes fine.,20
negative,It was slightly malformed and was very difficult to put in. I don't think these are actually the same design as the original Frigidaire brand. It was close but not as well made. I hope it lasts.,20
positive,"We've had this fridge for about a month and it has been an excellent performer. I must say however that when we first got it and turned it on, I was quite dismayed by the amount of noise. This turned out to be a temporary issue related to the fridge's start-up turbo cool mode designed to get the fridge's temperature equalized quickly. Once that happened, the fridge has been whisper quiet ever since.<br /><br />We were torn between the Whirlpool and the Samsung RF4287 and after much research, we opted for the Whirlpool. Being an American made fridge, parts are easy to come by in the unlikely event that a repair is needed. Samsung has had allot of complaints in regards to parts availability that I can personally attest to. Six years ago we had a Samsung ""Twin Cooling"" fridge that took a dump after about a year and they had to replace it as parts were not available. The Samsung french door RF4287 is a beautiful fridge if aesthetics are your primary concern.<br /><br />The features on this fridge are outstanding. Others have complained about the Ice-maker and we have had no problem. In fact, Wifey likes to make dietary Protein Shakes about three times a day and the Ice-maker is up to the task with lots of ice to spare. We also like the fact that the ""in-door"" design frees up a portion of the top shelf that is typically taken up with other brand's Ice-makers. The measured water dispenser is also another groovy feature not found on other fridges.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend this product",20
positive,Good value,20
positive,Great option and you can‚Äôt beat the price.,20
negative,Sucked. Did not fit.,20
positive,"I was so happy that this product arrived very quickly even though I asked for normal shipping.  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality because the price was cheap.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was the difficulty my husband had installing it.  It has been a couple of weeks since he installed it, and I have used the product many times and it works great!",20
positive,"I wanted to try a machine other than the same Keurig I'd used over and over again. I like Cuisinart products, so I purchased this model. The reservoir needs refilling often, so it's a pain when entertaining. The water doesn't get hot enough to keep warm in the cup very long. What caused me to donate the machine was the coffee grounds in the cup. Whether it was the first cup of brew or the next cup of hot water, there were grounds floating. This is bad enough in coffee, but horrible in the tea that followed it! I guess the Keurig is the alternative brand to buy now. Too bad.... I usually love Cusinart products.",20
positive,I have been using these for several years with good success.  They fit well and are easy to install.,20
positive,Saved me from buying a new microwave by replacing the broken door latch lever on my Panasonic microwave.  Very easy to replace.,20
positive,Awesome product and great price too!!!,20
negative,"Did not fit my knobs. Disappointed. I didn't realize my knobs were a different shape than o others. The hole in the back would not go over the part it was supposed to. My old ones fit I bought a few years ago, but not these.",20
positive,"I barely write reviews, and have never written one for something I bought years ago but for this I just have to. This dishwasher has been used at least once a day for almost two years in my home. A few times we've had to clear the drain of gunk but that's all, it's never given us any issues. We are a family of three and it's big enough to handle all our daily dishes minus the pots and pans. This thing is a total lifesaver for dumpy apartment living and I can't recommend it enough!!",20
positive,Great items.  Saves on paper filters and has a better taste.,20
positive,"Fits and works great, nice to have a spare as well",20
positive,"We were able to fix our leaking dishwasher all by ourselves. Water would come pouring out the bottom of the dishwasher almost every cycle, usually about halfway through the cycle. The old one just twisted right off. This part fit exactly like the original. No more leaks!",20
positive,I love it:),20
positive,Great product,20
positive,Amazing!  They fit perfectly without covering the barcode.  I used to make my own.  This is better and may be cheaper considering the materials to make your own.,20

positive,"Started using this item March 3 and was great, yesterday April 28 stopped working, it is past the time to return to Amazon but has a year warranty. I have done everything asked to return under warranty but I have to pay to return it! I paid $106 for this ice maker and FED EX INFORMED ME ITS $57 TO RETURN IT!!!!!!!!<br />I DO NOT RECCOMMNED YOU TO PURCHASE THIS ITEM",20
positive,Worked like a charm.  Great part at an even greater price.,20
positive,"Exactly as described, works perfectly with the perfect pod. Removes the hassle and mess of cleaning the coffee grounds out of the perfect pod, plus they‚Äôre biodegradable and compostable!

negative,Installed the ice maker and it doesn‚Äôt work,20
negative,The plastic does not sit flushed when it is closed. You could still see egg. Out of the plastic closing clasp seems like it would wear out pretty quickly,20

positive,"I've had my current Samsung refrigerator for a little more than 2 years. The water dispenser button decided to crap out, so I ordered this part to replace it. It took less than a minute for me to remove the old cover and pop this one into place. Couldn't be happier about the part. Delivery by USPS is a completely other issue, but the part is solid.",20
positive,Prompt delivery. My contractor that installed this said it was one of the easiest installs he had done. I like the look of it. The fan doesn‚Äôt seem to have too much suction but it still works great. Lights are great.,20

positive,Exactly as described.,20
positive,exactly what I ordered fast,20
negative,Extremely poor product support. Ice maker never worked correctly. The ice would come out as one big piece. I worked with adjusting the ice cube size. It just kept doing the same thing.  Between the week delay to get installed and the couple of weeks playing with adjusting the ice maker trying to get it to work correctly I got outside the 30 day return policy. They would not consider replacing. Poor support of the product.  I have purchase many various parts from multiple vendors that have always stood behind their products. This place does not support their customers. There are many other vendors offering this ice maker. Recommend to stay away from this vendor.,20

After about eight months the bearings began to grind again, sounded like a jet engine. I just reviewed my previous order and it says the condition of the parts I purchased was ""used-good"". I had no idea I was purchasing used parts. There is nothing in the Amazon listing that says ANYTHING about being used. It just says genuine Whirlpool parts. I feel like I was ripped off.",20

negative,"I didnt' really want a humidity sensor.  I only got it because my city requires it and I was afraid my inspection would not pass without it.  Thankfully, the inspector was more concerned with the electrical in other rooms and he didn't give much attention to my new bath fan and humidity sensor/switch.  I can still use this switch to turn my fan on and off.  However, after about two weeks it stopped turning on automaticallly when I have the shower on the hottest setting and the bathroom gets steamy.  It's not a big deal and it's not worth the effort to remove it and return it.  However, if this had stopped working right before the day of my inspection, I would have been upset.",20

negative,"This ice machine looks good, and works OK, but the ice does not freeze hard enough and has a sheen of water on each bullet of ice, so that they tend to freeze together in chunks.  The ice is transferred from the machine to the freezer right away, but it is wet and so will freeze in large chunks and I have to take a hammer and break-up the chunks so that I can use the ice in a glass or water bottle.  It needs to keep the ice frozen harder so that the bullets don't stick together.",20

positive,"This are very nice, I gave them as a gift and were well received.",20
negative,Bought these to use in my classic Keurig and they did not work.  The filters must be too heavy for the coffee to drip through on my model coffeemaker.  I thought my Keurig was broken or clogged since coffee on the large cup option only gave me about 1/4 cup.  I've used another brand paper filters in the past without problems.  I bought these because the other brand was out of stock.,20

However, the whole cord to plug it in came out of the back of my machine completely after several uses and looks as if the wires just weren't tightly in place. I understand things happen sometimes in production and I thought I or someone in my house had accidently tugged on it too hard or something similar. Anyhow, I E-mailed the seller not even knowing it came with a warranty. Y'all, they sent me a brand new one absolutely free after a few more e-mails back and forth and some photos. And it arrived at my door within days of them confirming so I had a new one all in less than a week and didn't have to spend the money to send the old one back. I never write reviews but this seller and their product amazed me! I would definitely recommend this machine and any other products they may offer!",20
positive,"Lots of filters at a great price. Finding Bunn filters in a grocery store is like panning for gold in your swimming pool. Only the big box, everyone needs a scooter to shop there, store carries these but they stock them with the coffee pots not the coffee like the other brands they carry. Not sure why either! These are so much cheaper too!!!",20

No clicking no more uo code (vent open) however we got to the last 15 minutes of the drying cycle and came up with a uf (vent failure) code on the brand new unit we just installed. The best part is, the fan didn't fail. It was running just fine.  The product was definitely easy to install, but there appears to be some sort of failure on the fan in the product we received.  So too good to be true! Money down the drain sadly.",20

I have tried to brush it, soak it, flush water through it...but nothing really seems to improve it much. Can anyone suggest a cleaning method that works so that all the holes are open?",20

positive,"I had a difficult time comparing this to the HIC version that's significantly cheaper.  I ended up getting both, and this one is the one I'll keep.  I've uploaded some product photos to help others make the comparison.<br /><br />- Weight and thickness: the HIC is significantly heavier and thicker than the Frieling Cilio.  I like the lighter weight of this one.<br /><br />- Number of drain holes: HIC has three, Frieling Cilio has one larger one. No noticeable difference in draining time.<br /><br />- Outer diameter of bottom rim: this is the ring that helps keeps the filter holder in place on your carafe.  Frieling Cilio has a smaller diameter (2 7/16"") vs. HIC (2 3/4""). My carafe opening diameter is also 2 3/4"" which makes the HIC very awkward and unsteady. Your carafe needs to have a larger diameter opening than the bottom rim on the filter holder.<br /><br />Small differences, but they add up.  I like the Frieling Cilio much better; it's worth the extra cost.",20
negative,"I bought this shelf so my knives would not fall behind my stove. My bad for not measuring the gap between my stove and wall.  The gap is too wide. I could not use as a stove shelf even if the fit was perfect because the magnets do not hold the shelf in place. Always looking for a resolve, we mounted on the wall and I am happy with that option.  For comparison, the size of magnet agains a teaspoon.  The shelf came with two magnets.",20

positive,"I took a chance and bought this part for my Kenmore side by side model no. 106.52562100 although Amazon's &#34;make sure this fits your model&#34; couldn't verify that this was correct for my refrigerator.  It fits my refrigerator just fine!  I looked at an Appliance Pro video on YouTube after entering &#34;ice door W10823377&#34; in the search engine (p/n W10823377 which I received replaces 8201649) and found it to be appropriate with minor differences.  The ice and water dispenser panel came off fairly easily when I used a screwdriver and a plastic card at each lower corner of the panel to pry it off.  Then I noted that several wires going to the panel ran directly out of the refrigerator door to the panel unlike what the video showed so I made a sketch of the hook-up and then removed the each wire from the panel.  Other than that, the video showed a tinnerman nut on the pivot pin of the ice door, but, my pin was mounted in 2 plastic tabs, one of which had a split in it to allow removing the pin.  I was extremely concerned about possibly breaking off the tab with the split during pin removal so I carefully pried it out with a small screwdriver then pressed in the new pin.  The total installation took me about 45 minutes and another 45 minutes to clean out mold in the area of the ice door.  The new ice door works great and cured my ice jamming problems caused by the old ice door allowing warm air to leak in.  I'm very pleased to have bought my ice door from Amazon!",20

negative,"I am sending this back tomorrow. I have purchased several portable ice makers over the last 8 years. They will last on the average of 2 yrs if you use them everyday like we do. I cannot hook up an ice maker in my ref. even though our new frig. is made to hook one up. Therefore, if we want ice cubes this portable one is what we have to use. This is the first time I have purchased the RCA ice maker and first of all it is smaller than the other ones we purchased but, that is no problem since there are only two of us. However, I plugged it in, put in water and it would not start. I read troubleshooting and it said to unplug, turn off, drain some water out of plug and try to restart. I put more water in plugged it back in and restarted. Nothing did this two more times. Finally it made a bucket of ice. By morning it was all gone. I tried to make more ice. Nothing I could do would make it work again. I do mean nothing. I contacted Amazon and they are taking it back. Since it is really so, small and I don't trust this brand I decided to just try a totally different one. I am hoping the insurance I took out will pay for the return shipping too. We shall see.",20

positive,"I love this product for the most part but there are some issues. It leaks a ton from the suction cups and the base of the drainage hose, and the fill line is nearly impossible to see. It also rattles a ton and twists when you do the spin dry. All said though it keeps my delicates looking perfect, is easy to use, saves water, and I love it.

The Solofill cup is easy to use, easy to clean & holds enough grounds to make a nice strong 18 ounce cup of coffee. It's also more economical & land fill friendly since you're not throwing out the lids or cups (although the cup are recyclable).

negative,"There are several things wrong with this range hood. It doesn't seem to draw a lot of air. While the two filters on the bottom seem large, they are so close to the hood's circular fan that only a portion of their surface has air flowing through it. The overhanging part of the hood also does nothing to trap smoke, steam, or hot air and draw it toward the filters; if you boil a big pot of spaghetti on a front burner, most of the steam rolls off the front of the hood and into the room. Worse, grease that does get trapped in the filters (or on the inside of the hood above the filters, collects quickly and starts to drip from the filters back onto the stove. This happens after about a week of cooking, despite that fact that we do very little frying.<br /><br />There is another, minor, point that bothers me: the hood doesn't use standard light bulbs. Instead of being in a pocket behind a diffuser, the top of the bulbs project downward from the front of the hood. You have to use short bulbs with a flattened top. I would rather have the option of using standard round bulbs, and I would never want to put compact florescent bulbs in this hood, even short ones, as you would be looking directly at the bulbs' coils.",20

Different brands over the years.<br />This one is my preference because the metal mesh frame just seems to fit better when inserting it.<br />However, I have not tested this one yet. So in about 9 months, I will revisit this review if it is no good or problems come up.<br />It is important to use the bacteriostat treatment and clean the tray regularly or, these things can get gross. I use my humidifier from about November to March almost 24 hours a day. I did not need to change this until the end of the season. Then I tossed it. So one of these a year, with bacteriostat is all you need. Otherwise, I'd use 2-3 a season with cleaning and change every couple of months for sure.<br />Tip: my older humidifier fan got dirty. So end of season, I carefully removed the screws (needed an 8 inch Phillips to do it) that holds the fan to the base and wiped it all down with a ‚Äúgreen‚Äù style cleaner. So you don't need to toss a humidifier with fan parts and chamber that are dirty. Just go buy or borrow a cheap long Philips and clean it up yourself!",20

negative,"I bought my dryer directly from a Miele dealer locally and in less than 4 years it started failing intermittently but initially I thought it was user error. I called for service when I thought it stopped working completely and was given an appointment that was 5 weeks in the future! When I asked why it would take so long for service and how I was supposed to manage in the meantime, they offered the option of a non-Miele service tech. Fortunately, I realized that certain steps could coerce the dryer into working during the long wait for service. After 10 days of never being called by the third party as promised by Miele, I called them again to complain and they offered to schedule their service tech the next week. He came and ran computer diagnostics which said there was nothing wrong with the machine. I told him that the person I spoke with on the phone believed that my problem was in the door lock mechanism and he was supposed to be bringing this part. He could not find the part on his truck and said he would be back in a few days. I called service to ask &#34;what gives?&#34; and they gave me a new appointment time in the next week. The service tech returned and disassembled the front of the machine where he showed me an electrical circuit connection that had never been properly connected. Over the years of vibration from the machine running it had become more loose and eventually would presumably completely disconnect. He plugged it in properly and the machine worked fine. My issue is that the &#34;repairs&#34; cost over $300 - there is a $125 fee for simply coming to your home and then there are parts and labor. This is a factory defect but I was told that the warranty is only good for one year. My advice would be to steer clear of the fancy name because the reputation only matches that in terms of cost.",20

It also helped out with how loud the machine is when it is on the spin cycle. I'm sure there are tons of other uses for it as well. It's really well made, nice materials. It is super simple to put together and to adjust it and everything too. I'm going to get another for the dryer now.",20
positive,"First off - you don't have to change your current brew method at all. I got ALTURA The DISC: FINE, and it comes with an instruction card saying to use the ""inverted"" brew method. This is not required. Brew your Aeropress the normal way, and this reusable filter works just like you'd expect.<br /><br />I mostly wanted a permanent filter as the Aeropress store went down during Covid, so I need to think about having a permanent filter on hand just in case the last of my paper filters run out. I'll be using the permanent filter to extend my stack of papers, and it would also be really handy if I travel to not carry around any paper filters.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Direct replacement for paper filters. Press your coffee the same way, with no need to throw a paper filter way. This is great for travel or just when you're running low on paper filters.<br /><br />Flavor is basically the same. I haven't noticed much of a difference. ALTURA claim The Disc allows more natural oils to flow out versus paper, and many people claim they can taste paper, it doesn't make a big different to me. Natural variation in process seems to be a bigger factor for me.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />The Disc is made to fit the cylinder, but is smaller than normal paper filters. This is annoying, because you can't just slap the Disc into the end cap like you'd do with a paper filter. This is a puzzling omission. ALTURA should fix it. The only reason they recommend the inverted press method in the instructions is so you can make sure the disc is fit properly onto the cylinder. It's silly.<br /><br />There will be sediment. When you grind and steep coffee beans, you get some dust all the way down to microscopic size. Paper filters are fairly good at pulling this out, so you barely notice sediment and there is usually no noticeable difference in the last sip of coffee versus the first. Methods which have larger holes, such as the Disc or French Press, allow more sediment into the cup. This may affect your last sip, and will certainly leave some sediment in the cup. Again, I barely notice a difference taste-wise, and you only have to swirl a splash of water in the cup to clean it. No big deal to me. But other people may find sediment ""gross"".<br /><br />The disc will be boiling hot after you press coffee, meaning you can't just pop the grounds into the trash (or compost) like normal. The best method seems to be pulling off the cap and ejecting what you can so the plunger can rest, then leaving the end cap complete with Disc and leftovers in the sink until it cools down. Then either toss the leftover grounds or rinse clean, depending on how much is left. This slows down the process if you're in a hurry, and is a little less convenient than paper filters. Personally, I'm fine with the trade-off. But it's worth noting.<br /><br />Neutral:<br /><br />The press feels different with the Disc. In particular, the fine mesh has a harder time pushing all the air out. Following the Aeropress instruction you should NOT be trying to force the plunger down. This only compacts the coffee and increases the resistance. Just allow the weight of your arm and a little pressure to help the plunger down, and you'll get the fastest press you're going to get. Once the Aeropress starts to ""hiss"" due to having pushed most of the water our, the Disc really seems to restrict airflow. This adds a few seconds to finishing off the press time, but again, most of the water is out already. It doesn't impact flavor much.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />For my purposes, the Disc is great. It could stand some improvements - in particular, it should be the same size as a paper filter so I can just slap it onto the end cap in the morning instead of fiddling with the alignment. But otherwise, the trade-offs can be worth it. It's a little harder to clean, but you don't have to carry paper filters. It leaves some sediment, but there's no paper taste if that bothers you. I'll be keeping the Disc in my rotation, and i'll be great to carry when traveling.",20

positive,These baskets are very nice quality and allow you to save money on buying the plastic K-cups every time you want a cup of coffee.  I love my K-cup coffee maker but I do not like how wasteful buying and disposing of the K-cups are.  This is such a great idea and they work very well.  There literally is no down side to purchasing these.  You can buy much better quality coffee than you could ever buy that already comes in a K-cup.  Why fill our landfills with plastic?  Use these for your coffee maker - you won't be disappointed!,20

After looking at the over priced  pods, I decided if I could make this work and maintain the depth of flavor in my coffee that I'd have a pretty good thing goin.  When I first used this product, I was gravely disappointed, because the flavor I was looking for just wasn't there.  I contacted Perfect Pod and let them know of my dissatisfaction.  They wrote back, telling me that I need to use 4 1/2 Tablespoons per pot of coffee.  In addition, they sent me a box of little paper filters that fit inside of this filter....Euphoria!  My coffee was affordable and delicious.  I don't recommend using without the filters however, because you end up with that muddy sediment that few people like.  These people are awesome to work with!",20

positive,"I recently bought an [[ASIN:B000ZIKWWI Avanti Portable Washing Machine]] and [[ASIN:B005R597HA Avanti 110-Volt Automatic  Dryer]] and living in New York City means you have to make the most of every inch of space you have in your home. I did my research and this was the best price I could find, and it had free shipping too. I was surprised when I received my package just 2 days later and very early in the morning (For UPS 9:00 is kind of early) But J&R ships right from the city so, that explains why I got my package so fast. Now, The unit itself is sturdier that I expected. Its made of really hard metal and my husband had no problem putting it together, but he's a professional installer and has lots of tools and usually gets a kick out of assembling complicated stuff. Since the unit was designed for the [[ASIN:B005R597HA Avanti 110-Volt Automatic  Dryer]] it fits perfectly. We had to remove the legs before placing it on the top shelf and then screw them back from under the slats. This securely attaches the dryer to the shelf so there's no way it can slide off. The dryer rocks slighlty when is tumbling the clothes, but  it would not fall down because it's ""screwed"" into the shelf. There is also a bracket to secure it against a wall but surprisingly, the bracket will create a 5-6 inch separation from the wall, which is weird, but I guess it's for ventilation or the hoses. I only found two minuses, one is that it's not the prettiest thing, but does the job; and two, it would be cool if it had locking wheels, but it doesn't. But I think that for 60 bucks it's a pretty good deal. I have a nice laundry center in my kitchen and I couldn't be happier!",20

Maybe the black is better?  I don't recommend the red ones.  Save your money.",20
negative,"This was not universal for all refrigerators listed. It did not fit in my refrigerator (even though the model number was listed on the filter), which caused water to leak all over my refrigerator.

positive,"I purchased the Ekobrew a couple of months ago when they were on special but did not use them until just recently. I have the Solo Cup and the EZ cup refills and continued to use the EZ Cup. One of my complaints about both the Solo and EZ cup was that my cup of coffee has always been a little on the weak side when using either of them in my favorite 10 oz setting in the Cuisinart SS-700. I tried the Ekobrew a couple of weeks ago and noticed that my coffee was a tad stronger, and just as I liked. I immediately compared the EkoBrew to the other two and could visibly see that it would hold more ground coffee, what looks like about 15 or 20% more. That was the difference!<br /><br />Since then, I have enjoyed my coffee just as I liked when using a regular coffee maker except one cup at a time and fresh each time!  I really like the EkoBrew and will continue using it!<br /><br />If you want just a little stronger cup of your favorite coffee not offered in the K-cups, this will help!",20

positive,Quality replacement.easy to install.,20
negative,I bought these cups to use with my Cuisinart (Keurig compatible) single serve coffee maker as I had lost the large lower part.  These replacements do not work properly as the cap does not fit tightly when screwed onto the base and water leaks out around the coffee grinds.  The result is that the coffee is weak and water drips out of the unit rather than down into the coffee cup.,20

positive,"With the cool air of fall settling in I tend to drink a lot more coffee, and since I'm a lazy bum I like using K-cups for both convenience and less clean up. Although the price of K-cup version 1 cups has dropped recently, they are still kind of pricey for higher end coffee brands so I decided to give this a try so I can use my own grounds. Some notes:<br /><br />What I like:<br />- Purple. I know it's an odd bonus, but I really like how they are purple in color, as I can very readily find them on the counter, in a drawer, or with a glance into the dishwasher.<br />- Dishwasher safe. Knock out the old grounds, rinse in the sink or toss in the dishwasher top rack.<br />- Lids seals well. There's a very small O-ring in the lid that helps these seal tight when closed, and I've yet to have any grounds in my cup. How long the ring will last is another question...<br />- Variable fill level. I prefer texas tar strength coffee, and these allow you to add an extra teaspoon of grounds over what you'll get in a normal K-cup (I use ~16g grounds as opposed to K-cups standard 10.5g) You can go heavier or lighter.<br />- Can save on landfill waste. No disposable cups/foil means less trash (because really, who recycles the cups).<br /><br />What I don't like:<br />- Hinge seems stressable. The hinge is just plastic and was already showing the telltale signs of stress (white discoloration) after a few dozen cups.<br />- Not universally usable. In my single cup brewer, the narrow top hole prevents the piercing needle from seating, thus preventing the coffee maker lid from closing. In my larger, older, actual Keurig machine this wasn't an issue, but if you have a smaller single cup brewer, this may not work.<br /><br />Overall I really found these useful. They allowed me to change up my brew strength and save a bit of green, but I was disappointed that the design prevented their use in my mini-brewer. 3.8/5 stars",20
positive,Fast shipping & worked perfect! Thank You!,20

positive,Not the same look as the old one but it fit perfect and has been working great for a week. I think it is doing the trick.,20
positive,"I have replaced this part 9-10 times.  (the dishwasher is the original that came with the house.  I suspect that there is something wrong with the door opening/limit mechanism that allows the door to open too far before it stops, thereby putting extra load on the cable-spring counterbalance parts.)<br /><br />it's fairly easy to replace, and this part is the same as the original.  The original design is weak at the eyelet, and breaks at the same spot every time.  but, replacing this part every 3-5 months is the only solution I've found.<br /><br />i'm giving this 4 stars because it's no worse than the original design.",20

positive,"Compared to paper filters, these let through a little more ground coffee.  Your last cup will be a bit Turkish.  Instead of throwing away the grounds and paper filter together, you get to wash the grounds down the sink, preferably before they dry out.  Also,these filters are not really permanent; they are more fragile than they look, so figure on buying a new one at least once a year.  That's OK with me; Mr. Coffee coffeemakers are reasonably durable, but they don't last forever either.  A metal filter of the right size is better than paper filters designed for a 12-cup basket, and that's the choice I have where I live now (in Ecuador), so this was a good buy.",20

I saw these offered as a ‚Äòlightning deal‚Äô so I figured it was worth a shot. What a fool I was. This falls under the ‚Äòif it looks too good to be true/you get what you pay for‚Äô category. They literally blow open and dump a pile of grounds into my cup about 30-40% of the time. I‚Äôve tried using a little more and a little less coffee but nothing makes a difference. Wasted coffee, wasted water, and wasted money. These things are frail trash. DO NOT BUY!",20

positive,"My wife and I have 5 kids, mainly because I love hospital ice.  We're too old to have more now and I'm tired of going to Sonic to buy ice.  This ice maker was a fantastic purchase and produces ice really quick.  Our friends look on in jealousy because of the ice we have on-demand at our house.  We have a neighbor that likes to come over with one of those really expensive souvenir big cups you get at college and pro sports events to fill it with ice for her Dr. Pepper.  I'm convinced we have the best ice on the block if not the entire neighborhood.  I should consider selling bags of this ice on the street corner.  I wonder if I need a permit for that?  Checks county laws....NOPE!  Ok you've heard the good.  Now for the bad.  It started making some loud noises after about 6 months.  I thought it was maybe the little ice elves that live inside the machine getting cranky because we make them work so hard producing ice non stop.  They probably regret leaving Santa and the North Pole.  Anyway, I reached out to Charles at Newair via their on-line chat function to see if we needed to get replacement ice elves for our ice maker.  They said nope, but they will replace it under warranty.  Oh yeah! I bet we get the fresh, upgraded ice elves that don't get cranky this time.  I'm thinking of cutting my neighbor off after we get the new unit.  I know she'll probably go through some hard core withdrawals.  Not my problem, she can go to Sonic.  Or make an investment in herself and feed her habit with one of these shiny new ice machines in her own home.  I'm done being an enabler!  If you've read this far.  In all seriousness, go out and buy one of these.  You will NOT regret your decision.",20
positive,Works as intended. What else can I say about a water filter? I'm not a laboratory and cannot actually test the filtered water quality.,20
positive,Good one,20
positive,"The bake element went out in my oven 6 months ago , over that time I've purchased two other elements that did not work. One heated up but it just wasn't very strong, the other just flat out didn't work. This Baking Element was a breeze to install and heated up rapidly. Also it's about half the price I paid for the others.  I am super pleased with it.",20
positive,"Prompt service, good product fit and fully met my expectations.",20
negative,"...and what it is not is a full-sized dryer.  This is basically the equivalent of hanging clothes on the shower rod and turning the hair dryer on them.  It takes 2-3 hours to dry 5 T-shirts, twice as long for 2 pairs of jeans.  I've taken to hanging items on a line in my bedroom until they're nearly dry and then finishing them off in this thing.  It's perfect if you want to dry a few small items (think baby clothes or underwear) but it doesn't replace a large dryer.",20

negative,filler works only with labedl from Kuerig pod.,20
negative,Don‚Äôt buy this product! The gasket comes off when replacing it and when putting the new one on it causes the filter to leak! Water will run down into the freezer causing the freezer to fill with water! Result; hundreds of dollars worth of damage and mad customers!!!!!,20
negative,2nd replacement filter I have bought. First one lasted 4 months before the water flow was so bad it would probably be faster to drive to my parents house and back to fill a glass.<br /><br />The 3rd filter I have bought has not even lasted more than a month with the same results. Original filter with the refrigerator lasted the suggested 6 months and we have not changed our water usage habits.<br /><br />This leads to one of three conclusions:<br />1.  The replacement filters are a scam designed to not last for extra cash.<br />2. Amazon is selling faulty defective filters.<br />3. These are horrible filters.<br /><br />Either way this will be the last Whirlpool refrigerator I will ever buy and am already regretting not getting the LG I was deciding between.<br /><br />Buyer beware these filters are not worth the money.<br /><br />[Edit: bought a large under the sink filter and I am going to stop using these altogether.],20

positive,"In a sentence, these things are freakin' fantastic!<br /><br />I recently had to replace a larger Keurig that accepted carafes and mug-size K-cups.  Those use a deep K-Cup holder.  The OEM filter it used was quite deep but dropped into the cup holder.  I purchased a K-Cafe model to replace it, but it uses a standard K-Cup depth holder.  The OEM version requires you to pop out the standard K-Cup holder from underneath, and replace it with a large filter holder assembly.  Besides it being a pain to remove, there is a chance it will break from the constant switching between filtered holders and normal K-Cup holder.  The design is a total PITA.  If that isn't enough, there are two on the market and only one works.<br /><br />Enter this solution.  This one drops right in like a regular K-Cup - no problems at all.  Combined with paper Pro Mael (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079BB71YR/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) filters, this setup couldn't be easier.  Just drop in a paper filter into this holder, pour in the coffee, close the lid, and place it in the Keurig like any other K-Cup.  Super easy.  The brewing results in a great cup of joe with no grinds in the mug whatsoever.  I might not ever go back to using normal K-Cups.<br /><br />Cleanup is super simple; pull out the filter unit, pop open the lid, and pull out the paper filter with grinds and throw that out.  A quick rinse of the lid and you are done.  No grinds down in the body where the normal filter is.  This double-filter works great and is super easy to maintain.  Throw it in the dishwasher for an extra clean, but so far it hasn't been necessary.  After countless brews, the filters still look new and are not discolored at all.<br /><br />This solution is much more ecological, and the brews taste much better than the same coffee in a K-Cup.  The fact that you get more than one is icing on the cake.  Couldn't ask more.",20
positive,"Ordered these water filters for my refrigerator.  It was very convenient and easy to order them on line, and they came within the time promised.  The package was in good condition, and they were easy to install.  I will order again in the future.",20

negative,I received this as a gift for Christmas! I am so happy with this product. I have been filling up zip block bags and I put it in my deep freeze. When I get enough for about a week I turn it off for a couple of days. It has been a life savor!<br /><br />I wrote this review a couple of months ago! Just in the past 2 days it has quit working correctly. I called the company and explained to them that I recieved this as a Christmas present and I do not have the receipt nor does the person who bought it from me. They told me that it was not their problem and if I wanted their help in fixing it then I need to show them a reciept. I am very upset that they were not willing to help me in anyway. After I told them I did not have the reciept they quit talking to me. Was not willing to even talk about a solution.  So I am changing my stars.,20

positive,"I blame myself for not checking the measurements and assuming all fridges are universal. Make sure to check your measurements before ordering. Ours is a GE Profile and our drip tray is fairly shallow. The kids (ahem, and adults) are always leaving drips of water which cause calcification. Drives me nuts. We had gotten in the habit of putting small washcloths on the drip tray, but this is a more aesthetic solution. Not sure how absorbent the material is, it is kind of like a squishy mat. Tip: if you don‚Äôt want to drive your type A wife bonkers, use a straight edge and box cutter to make any necessary cuts and don‚Äôt eyeball it with scissors!",20

negative,"People you are CRAZY if you buy this fridge!  We bought ours a little over 2 years ago, worked fine till a couple of days ago.  Called out a repairman, he came out and I told him it wasn't cooling, he said ""uh oh, I think I know what's wrong with it, common for these Whirlpool refrigerators.""  So he proceeded to take the back off and check a few things.  Says there is a refrigerant leak in the ""sealed system""  And he said that unfortunately they stopped giving a 5 year warranty on this, now they only warranty it for one year.  But the really bad news is its not repairable... they leak is in the coils between the fridge and the freezer, they are molded inside and you cannot get to them.  So therefore it cannot be repaired.  So I did a little research online... this is VERY common for Whirlpool side by side fridges... Found 100s of complaints and not one of them said Whirlpool took care of their problem.  Even found one website where someone used to work for Whirlpool and they know this is a design flaw but will not do anything about it!  That's why they changed the warranty from 5 years to 1 year!!!!  And its not just this model, its all the side by side models!  NEVER, NEVER, NEVER will I buy another Whirlpool or Maytag product again!!",20

negative,"Literally the worst thing I have ever bought.<br />Worked great a few times. Then quit washing. I was using pods and they weren‚Äôt fully dissolving. So switched to name brand detergent. Didn‚Äôt make a difference. Dishes were still disgusting. Tried lightly used dishes. Like coffee cups. Nope didn‚Äôt clean at all. Tried an extremely light load. Nope. Doesn‚Äôt matter. Tried the heaviest setting on this thing. Nope. No difference. Contacted the company and was sent another one. I was thrilled because I thought maybe I just got a defective one. HA. 2020 has jokes. This dishwasher is for sure one of them. First cycle with the new one - didn‚Äôt do anything. THEN I thought I‚Äôd give it the benefit of the doubt and put some lightly used items in. Just to see how they‚Äôd come out. Water didn‚Äôt drain properly with this cycle. So like the sticker said on the front of the machine - slightly tilt, which isn‚Äôt easy because this thing is heavy and bulky. All the water still didn‚Äôt empty. Which forced me to carry it outside and empty it. Piece of garbage.<br />Noise level wasn‚Äôt awful but not great for the price you pay.<br />The icons on the front are hard to read and you have to reference the manual several times to get used to the icons.",20

The only problem I have ( and it could be my dryer itself) the airflow pops the item off. I have a combination metal and attached plastic elbow and taped them securely to the vent and occasionally it still pops off; it may be from the heat of the dryer air drying out the tape. However, I am still very happy with this. It may be a bit pricey but I haven't found anything else that works as well so I am pleased.",20

Also if you pick it up after its been running, water will leak out of the back of it.  Its a cute novelty item, but if you really need it to keep something cooler then the room temperature its not worth it.

Also, I let the basket sit in the lid until I decided to brew a second cup or clean the basket out later.  The basket is wide enough to clean easily and slip back in my desk to be used the following day.  On a side note, after four weeks of drinking this tea and omitting coffee and black tea at work, my blood pressure went from 135/80 to 120/70.  I have suffered from high blood pressure for 17 years and have NEVER had such amazing results (even with medication and a healthy life style).  So, I will be guarding my Finum Brewing Basket with my life.",20
positive,That's all right,20
negative,I'm surprised by the good reviews for these because for me these cones drain SO SLOW I can't stand it. It takes double the time to make my coffee. I have been making pour over coffee exactly the same way for 5+ years with various brands of cones and have NEVER experienced such slow draining.,20
negative,"These stick very well to emptied Nespresso capsules that I reuse. They do not stick well to my sealpod capsules. I suspect it's the glue. If I prepare them in advance, overnight they start to lift up. Also, they tend to break apart in the center during brewing. I thought it might be from my grounds expanding against them, but my sealpod lids do not crack like that. While they are cheaper than the sealpods, I don't think I will reorder them.  I'll continue to try other brands looking for a less expensive option perhaps, or just stick with sealpods (pun intended).",20
positive,it the best,20
positive,"I was given kcups coffee for a gift but did not have a keureg coffee maker. I have tried different coffee filters, but always got coffee grinds in my coffee. With this filter, I only have to set it on top on my mug with my coffee in and run hot water into the cup. It sits on top of the cup and keeps grinds out of the coffee. It can seep in the cup and then remove and drink. It is reusable and easy to clean. It is easy to transport to office or whereever. My daugheter kept &#34;borrowing&#34; mine so I had to order me another one. I now use it every day. I highly recommend this to anyone needed to make 1 coffee cup at a time.",20
positive,"Idk why there‚Äôs so many poor reviews! This machine came to me well packaged & perfectly intact. I use the eco cycle and it cleans my dishes amazingly.

It‚Äôs a little bit leaky in my sink (at the connection) I think some teflon tape would fix it.<br /><br />Main issue I had with this: the plastic mechanism it came with to organize the plug & faucet connections did not work. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the wrong one, but I ended up putting a hook up above where I store this machine so that was he plumbing didn‚Äôt leak everywhere after use. If it‚Äôs not upright the residual water will spill all over the floor.<br /><br />Overall, I‚Äôm very happy with this cute little machine. Now I don‚Äôt have to do any more dishes!",20
positive,"great item, great price fit exactly.<br />better quality than the original, this one is metal the original one is plastic",20
positive,Water taste great!,20
negative,Only lasted three months.,20
positive,This was everything I was hoping for. The only thing I don't like about it is that I don't feel like it stays super cold on there so when the bucket fills I dump it in our freezer. Which isn't really a problem for us at all. Seens as how our ice maker is right next to our fridge. Other than that it's top notch foe the price. Cubes last a long time in my drink even though they are not huge.,20

positive,"My dishwasher had a burnt electrical smell (no smoke) and after some investigation, seemed to be coming from this part.  Replaced it and no more burning smell!",20
positive,I was nervous about this fitting properly. I guess its a pretty standard size for several fridges. Perfect fit and good price compared to the other ones I found available online.,20
negative,"Great price, fast shipping but the filter did not allow water to pass thru!  Obviously defective from the box.<br />The filter is smaller in diameter and slightly shorter than a Samsung, but did not leak - just didn't allow water thru!",20
positive,Our fridge is old so parts are starting to crack but the fridge itself is fine. It was looking pretty junky so I looked up the shelf through whirlpool and it was $100. Found this knock off and was so happy it worked. I have a couple others I need to update.,20
negative,"1. Before installation it is important to completely submerge the filter in water and turn it where the water entrance (looks like a coin slot on the bottom of the filter) is under water but tilted up and rotated up so that the air can come to the uppermost point and exit the filter so then the filter can fill (prime) with water completely.<br /><br />2. For installation, make sure to tilt the filter down and position the round male end into the icemaker's filter receptacle. Then push the opposite end down to secure it in place. The angle is important to allow the male end into its proper place otherwise the filter will seem as if it will not fit. I did not have this issue but saw other reviewers had trouble with the fit and wanted to ensure everyone knows to install the filter initially with the male end down and the larger end at an angle up.<br /><br />Before installing this filter just to ""start fresh"" I performed the cleaning cycle with bleach then performed the overnight cleaning with white vinegar to remove scaling. I then performed the bleach cleaning cycle again. I was able to cycle water through the machine with no problems before installing the filter.<br /><br />Initially since the instructions did not include directions for priming the filter I installed without priming it with water first. The icemaker gave me the add water blue light code so I removed the filter and reinstalled it but got the same error code. (I went to my trash to ensure I had removed the plastic overwrap before installing!! LOL, yes, I had!) I then submerged the filter in water and ensured it was full of water with no air bubbles exiting the filter before installing. The icemaker worked then but the next day after a time of being turned off I had to remove the filter again and resubmerge in water and reinstall. I also drained some water without the filter as if to clean the machine just to ensure there was no clog internally and found no issues. I reinstalled the filter and since then the icemaker has not given me the error code and has so far worked with the filter installed. I am writing this 2-3 days after initial installation. (SEE UPDATE BELOW)<br /><br />Notes for me to try with next new filter if this one doesn't continue to give me trouble: Try installing the filter without priming but with no water in the ice machine after cleaning (before adding water to the water reservoir). I already had water in the water reservoir below the ice drawer on initial installation so perhaps that added an air gap that prevented the proper water flow initially.<br /><br />I posed the question asking if priming is necessary in the questions section of this item and received responses of yes and no so if you are having trouble try one way or the other or both. :-) GE's answer was that priming is not necessary.<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers that the filter instructions could be written with a lot more clarity and details. (The Opal ice machine instructions could use the same update.)<br /><br />I'm not convinced it is a good value for the money. It is priced twice as much as other filter models by the same manufacturer for the same icemaker but not sporting the GE Opal logo. Of course GE Opal recommends their branded product as the only filter they endorse. I feel I'm paying twice as much for the brand.<br /><br />My ice has still been tasty and chewy so I'm happy. I may detect a slightly cleaner taste but not a huge improvement overall. I would say the cleaning may have improved the taste in addition to the filter change. I clean my machine if the ice production slows down, about every 2 to 3 months. I have been using tap water which leans hard vs soft. Hopefully the filter will extend the amount of time between cleanings. Time will tell....<br /><br />UPDATE (approximately 5 days after initial installation)<br />My Opal machine is on a schedule so today when it turned on I once again got the ""needs water"" blue light code. I removed the filter and ""primed"" the hole the filter fits into by pushing my finger on and off the hole as I read somewhere online this troubleshooting method. I then reinstalled the filter and my machine is again making ice. I'm trending towards thinking this filter is not worth all the extra attention I'm having to give it to coax it to work with my ice machine. I'm reducing to 3 stars from 4.<br /><br />UPDATE (approximately 6 days after install)<br />Once again have the needs water blue light code after turning on. I will message the seller about getting a replacement. I have reduced my review from 3 stars to 2)<br /><br />UPDATE (after receiving replacement filter)<br />I returned the initial filter and received a replacement. Unfortunately I am still getting the *needs water* blue light. I have tried all the above methods again to no avail. I have returned the 2nd filter for a refund and my chewable ice will be made with filterless water. I don't think this product is worth trying. I've made a valiant attempt to get this it to work, tried more so than most, and am reducing my assessment by yet another star...Final Answer.",20

positive,"We've been using one for our wet bar for six months now 24x7 with great results.  It's used regularly, and the water is exchanged every few days and we occasionally run a cleaning cycle with a little vinegar in the water.  Have also used it in our RV, and discovered that the ice will stick to the freezing points instead of releasing properly if the water is too pure..  At home we just use a sediment and carbon filter, but in the RV, we have two of those types and were then using a Brita filter for the water, which must have lowered the total dissolved solids (TDS) too low for it to remain slightly above freezing to release.  The manual/FAQ mentions not using distilled water or water too low in TDS, and experienced the reason why.",20

Pushed the power button and it cycled through-BOOM, add water even though it was filled to the MAX line. I tried everything I can think of to get it going but NOTHING. Sending it back ASAP!!",20
negative,"We bought this range because it was a duel usage range hood for either a vented or non-vented application.  This  range hood is NOT the right choice for someone using it unvented.  It requires a 6.25"" hole in the floor of the cabinet.  It blows open the cabinet doors open onlow if you try to use the fan.  It also requires carbon filters, which I purchased (they were on backorder and I have yet to receive them...although my CC has been charged.)  Anyhow,  the install was a nightmare.  I'm sure a good portion of that was because we thought it would be easy and didn't take into consideration that the 6.25"" hole would need to be cut in a very awkward place.  The placement of the vent hole on the range is too far back for what I would consider a standard installation.  We had to cut-away portion of the cabinet bracing piece along the back of the wall.  (Forgive me if my terminology is incorrect)  Rather than go through it step by step, I will simply say it was a bad, uninformed choice.  I was swayed by the good looks and the fact that the stainless steel matched my slide in range nicely.  It is a nice looking range hood and the price wasn't terrible.  I will only be using the fan if absolutely  necessary anyway but that is not the point.  Also, the light panel is rather annoying with it's always on red light and sometimes on blue.  Unfortunately all appliance companies think we need to know the time on each and every appliance.  I have the time on my range, range hood, coffee machine and microwave.  Geez.  Corner of the kitchen is lit up!  Finally, the last thing is the customer service.  I emailed and then finally had to call the company.  They weren't helpful and sounded quite annoyed I had questions about installation.  I suggested that the carbon filters ($25)  should be part of the original purchase if in fact the range hood was designed for either a vented or non-vented application...Crickets on the other end of the line. I will have to call back and find out where my expensive carbon filters are to boot.  Hope this helps someone else trying their best to remodel their kitchen in a DIY fashion.  Sorry, not photos of install as it was all we could do to get it up and not kill each other in the process!!",20

I owned mine a full year before I started noticing mineral deposits or buildup forming along the bottom edges, the top corners, and crevices. I heavily sprayed with white vinegar, but not all the buildup dissolved. Soon, it formed nasty mold stains around the inside lid, the undersides, and the corners where you can't reach. So disgusting and a big joke. A prior ice maker I'd bought from Bed and Bath NEVER needed any such special cleaning or rinsing/drying out.<br />And....it DOES NOT make the 2 cube sizes that it claims.

positive,Diagnosed the problem with a family members dryer while visiting them in their new house. Something in the heating circuit was bad being that the heat was not working but the tumbler was. I didn't have an ohm meter on hand at the time to pin point what the main problem was so that's why this kit with everything in it is awesome. When I went back to replace these components I ohm tested everything and found the original high temp cutoff was blown. This made me wonder so I pulled off all the exhaust piping going out of the house and found multiple lint blockages causing excess build up of unexhausted heat. I cleared all the blockages and rerouted the poorly installed pipes so there are no sharp elbows where any lint that passes by the catcher can get hung up and clog again. I ohm tested all the new components and all was in good order. No complaints of any failures so far. Thanks for making this kit available!,20

positive,"I've used the plastic drippers for many years. I don't like the new configuration of the plastic brand I've used for so long and was ready to switch from plastic anyway. This porcelain dripper is well made and drips at the right rate through a hole of the right size. I had bored the hole of my two previous plastic ones  to a larger size. The gold colored filter that I've used for ten years or so fits perftectly in this, it stuck up probably three quarters of an inch over the top of the plastic ones.  I really like this, I reinforced the hook under a kitchen cabinet that I've hung the plastic ones on in anticipation of the new dripper's arrival. This one is much heavier.

Pkg came earlier than promised and well packed. I watched a u tube video on how to install it took less than 30 min. That was with cleaning internal while I had washer apart. Part fit perfectly and easy 2 install. I am a 55yr old woman and i was pretty proud of myself for tackling this! 10 loads in 2days n washer works great. Thx bluestar!,20
negative,I only gave it 3 stars because I've bought these things before from other sites with the same listed dimensions and the large one doesn't fit! It's slightly larger than the listed size. Sooo I'll just order from the previous folks.,20
positive,"Just got this as my old Melitta dripper broke and this one is really well made. It‚Äôs solid and heavy , very affordable with profound ribbing on the sides and has one drip hole, which drips a bit slow for strong coffee. But the main difference is that the bottom of the cone is a bit smaller than 2 inch, rectangular and sides more narrow than regular Melitta style cones. I did not have any issues using the #2 cone filter though it was not an exact fit. I also did not have any issues with cloth filters. But this difference I think, increases the bed depth of the grounds and makes a stronger cup. Highly recommended !",20
positive,Everything went great- came to the house quickly and the part works well now for several weeks so we‚Äôre very pleased,20
negative,Not what I wanted,20
negative,Please save your money. Part stripped out with in a month of use.,20
positive,Does what is supposed to.  Mines is a little long (by an inch)...but I imagine I could take it to the local hardware store and cut it to length with their metal saw if really needed.  Durable so far and seems like it will last the life of my oven.,20

positive,"I purchased the Danby 18-inch dishwasher after a few months of planning. I bought an older home without a garbage disposal or dishwasher, so this was part of my DIY project. I chose an 18-inch dishwasher because it fit into an existing cabinet opening. I had to remove the upper drawer and lower cabinet floor, but there was no need to widen the cabinet. In my pictures you can see the dishwasher installed, as well as another cabinet in my kitchen that has the same dimensions. The cavity width is almost exactly 18 inches wide by 32.5 inches tall, and I feel like the Danby fits perfectly. In this price range I found that there were really only 2 options: Danby and Edgestar. Although I liked the more traditional controls on the Edgestar, the Danby was about $50 cheaper and had similar reviews. The controls on this Danby unit are fine, but you definitely need to read the manual; they aren't intuitive. If I was installing the dishwasher in a place where it would be used by a lot of different people, I would have probably gone with the Edgestar for that reason. Performance has been fantastic. I'd say the sound level is normal, and my wife said she's pleasantly surprised with the sound as well. It also cleans by dishes just as well as the 24-inch Frigidaire model that I had in my previous home. I found that unlike in previous 24-inch dishwashers I've owned, rinse-aid is a must in this unit. Without rinse-aid, it does take a very long time for the dishes to become completely dry. Fortunately, the Danby has an indicator light that advises you when rinse aid is low, so this should make it hard to run out. Overall I'm very pleased with this dishwasher, especially since the more well-known brands are twice as expensive! My install took me a few days of casual working, as I was starting from scratch like I mentioned earlier. On the first day I installed a GFCI/AFCI 20 amp circuit to power both the dishwasher and garbage disposal, and installed the garbage disposal. As you can see from my photos, I wired all of the electrical into a single work box with a switch for the garbage disposal for simplicity. As I mentioned earlier, this is an older home, and it was more or less impossible to get the electrical up the wall from the shallow crawlspace below the sink. Furthermore, I didn't want to fool with the backsplash tile and potentially damage it. A different solution would have been an air pressure switch mounted on the counter-top, but that would have taken additional time. Overall I see little to no inconvenience with the in-cabinet switch, and my understanding is this was more common in the past, anyway. The next day I modified the cabinet and installed the dishwasher. The only additional part I needed that isn't typically included in a dishwasher install kit was a y splitter for my water supply. Obviously if you're replacing a dishwasher you'll already have a place to connect your water inlet hose, but given that I was starting from scratch I needed to do that. Since I wasn't installing an air gap, I made sure to route the drain line pretty high to mitigate the risk of a drain backup.  On a different day I re-plummed the drain to eliminate my outdated s-trap and to provide a more appropriate and efficient route for my new setup. I also filled some imperfections in the wood trim, sanded, and painted. Although I would have preferred a 24-inch model, this Danby has really brought my kitchen into modern times, and I couldn't be happier. I highly recommend it to anyone who needs an 18-inch solution who's trying to avoid the high prices of the major brands!",20

negative,This set of suspension rods made my washer worse than it was before.,20
negative,"I wish I listened to the bad reviews on this, because they are true.<br />I purchased these hoping it would be sufficient to keep track of things until I was able to purchase and set up a permanent solution for heat and humidity monitoring an emergency reptile rescue situation.<br />These have been in use for 3 weeks. One never reads above 77.7 degrees F for temperature despite many controlled tests.  Comparing the reads on these to instant reads on 2 different temp guns they are never correct, typically reading 5-9 degrees colder than the temp gun and my other digital thermometers, occasionally 4-7 degrees higher.  Would give 1 star but they have been accurate within 2-3% consistently with humidity which was the ONLY reason I chose these over ones that did not gauge humidity.<br /><br />Update: Within a few days of the original review the humidity started to show huge variants. Tested against a trusted digital they were all off by 17-38%.<br /><br />tl;dr Save your money, these are absolute garbage and not even worth something to use in a bind. The most useful part of this product will be the batteries salvaged from them.",20

positive,"Great little machine, but washing even one pair of jeans in there would not work. It is that small.",20
positive,"Ok. I have had this little washer going on 5 days. Yesterday washing  all day non stop about 7-8 hours. Had lots of piled up loads. Example 4 towels one load. One king fitted sheet one load.  Two sweat shirts one sweat pants size 3x one load. 5 regular button up shirts size 3x one load. 3 jean shorts size 3x one load. About 35 wash cloths(I don‚Äôt use paper towels) one load. Other small loads not as important. Today was the 2 stinky dirty twin fitted sheets single load each from my two Great Danes beds they have indoor outdoor access all during the day when I‚Äôm home. 12 days of stink! I don‚Äôt usually let it go past 5 to 7 days. I cleaned machine after last load of dog sheets now she sits empty with lid open to prevent musty smell from happening, waiting for next weeks wash day. impressed with this little work horse of a machine! Keep your loads small enough to move freely. Don‚Äôt pack it. Highly recommended for every day clothes, twin size blankets. I wouldn‚Äôt put a twin comforter or winter jacket in this small machine.

negative,"I bought this over a year ago.  It best suits my needs to use it intermittently, filling a gallon zip bag and keeping it in the freezer until I need more.  I have also used it for 8 or 10 hours straight to produce ice for parties, and it always worked fine.<br /><br />The one and only issue came a few weeks ago.  I like to take the ice and put it in a bag in the freezer the moment the machine drops it into the bin (it's coldest then and freezes hard almost immediately - no problem with cubes freezing together), so I work at the kitchen table while it's running.  At the end of a cycle (it had been working just fine up until then), I noticed it dropped some cubes but didn't give the beep signal that indicates a complete cycle.  I waited a couple of minutes and went over to look at the machine.  Some of the cubes had gotten stuck in the mechanism, and it was producing a faint smell of warm machinery, not a burning smell, but warm rubber or something.  I shut it off and let the stuck cubes melt off.  When I turned it back on everything was fine, and continues to be fine to this time.<br /><br />So be aware.  I think if I had walked away from the machine it would eventually have burned out since the servo mechanism was locked with stuck ice cubes.  Except for that incident the Whynter Ice Maker has worked perfectly, and continues to work perfectly - I'm making cubes at this very moment.  I would happily give it more stars if not for that incident.",20

I have contacted GE, and they say the warranty is up and offer 20% off a new one.  With this price, I would expect the machine to last longer.  I've followed all instructions on cleaning the ice machine,I use filtered water, and it still produces black film.  My sister also bought a unit and has already had to replace hers in less than two years.  Other than that it makes great ice and I have loved having it.  I'm a bit miffed that I have to buy another one so soon.  It should last more than two years for the price.",20

negative,"This beverage center proved to be a very bad purchase for our family. However, at the end of my bad-news story, there is a happy ending.<br /><br />The first Danby DBC120BLS Beverage Center we ordered lasted 3 months before it stopped working. No warning; it just died a mysterious and unexpected death. Amazon was wonderful and quick to replace the lemon, which we hauled to the street for city pickup. The second (identical) Danby functioned but was so terribly loud that the noise intruded on conversations, TV watching, napping, and everything else connected with daily living. Our oversized fridge, in the same room, was silent compared to the little-but-clamorous Danby Beverage Center. The noise was driving us crazy, so we contacted Amazon.<br /><br />Amazon told us to contact the manufacturer, and the manufacturer told us to contact Amazon. (You know how THAT goes.) If we were to hope for a replacement, Danby required an authorized technician to examine the appliance. We scheduled a visit and waited (and waited) our turn. The technician agreed the noise was abnormally loud. He said the Danby needed a new compressor, which would cost more than the purchase price of a new unit. He suggested that Danby simply replace the appliance.<br /><br />Despite the authorized technician's written report, Danby squabbled about a refund. We were, however, welcome to crate and ship the unit back to them -- a heavy-lifting project that would end up costing as much in handling/shipping as the mini-fridge itself. (You can imagine our frustration.) Long story short: Danby non-cheerfully sent us a refund for the beverage center, which we unplugged and got rid of ASAP. Now what? We still needed a beverage center to fill the hole in our kitchen. We certainly were not willing to try another Danby, although it was the exactly-right size for our cabinetry.<br /><br />Here's the solution: First, we searched online for all beverage centers of appropriate dimensions, including units that were smaller than the above Danby. Next, we researched each of the units on our list to compare features, price, and RATINGS FROM CUSTOMERS. Because excessive noise is a common complaint in these little fridges, we did not want to order a new one (of any brand) and get stuck, again.<br /><br />We found a beverage center that looked good on paper and was not criticized for noise: Summit Model SCR312L. We had never heard of this brand before. We found out it was sold online by a &#34;big box&#34; store but was not available in-store. We spoke with the local store manager, told her we were interested in the Summit, but would need to plug it in at the store to listen to it before we committed to it. She agreed to order it for us; no problem... Well, the Summit SCR312L passed the test! It cools AND it is quiet!  It isn't as tall as the Danby, but it holds a lot more than it looks like it will hold, which is enough for us. We use the excess space at the top to store a decorative box filled with extra beverages... Did I mention that this little fridge is quiet? ... My intention is not to promote Summit here. But I am suggesting that you find a way to see and hear the product before installing it in your home. We learned the hard way.",20

It's a single-use fuse, it blows once - you need to replace it.<br />A blown fuse tells you that the problem is elsewhere - the heater overheats.<br />You need to replace it with the other 2 thermostats, in my case it's the kit 279816 and the cycle thermostat 3387134.<br />It's hard to tell which of the 2 resettable thermostats are bad, when they are bad they don't shut off, and the heater overheats. The first one to shut off is the cycle thermostat, then the other resettable one, and then the fuse.<br />After replacing test the heater - it should come on and off during the cycle.",20
positive,"So far so good. I was amazed to find it so cheap, but it said it was a genuine part, so I bought it. It came quickly & was easy to install. No complaints yet.....",20
negative,"Hard to clean, too small to allow good space for grounds and boiling water to steep.  Hard to remove for pouring or cleaning.<br />Drains too fast into the Chemex.",20
positive,I had two of my knows break on a range that was only 18 months old. A search of the internet told me that this is a very common problem with many fixes out there.  I bought these metal reinforced knobs instead of a home fix.  They fit the range fine.  I won't say how well they last until its been more than a week.,20
positive,"I have been using them for about a week so far, and after four loads of dishes they seem to be holding up fine. (Knock on wood). I would buy them again.",20
positive,this washing machine is almost better than the regular size.  I bought it and a portable dryer for my teen because she hates going to our laundry room.  she now keep her laundry done.  I wish I had bought this years ago .,20

positive,Why wouldn't you buy one best ice maker ever lol,20
positive,If you need a pump and only want to do it once this is the one to purchase. One year warranty  !,20
positive,The reason we never purchased Keurig Coffee machines in  he past is how bad single-use plastics are. These little cups are easy  to fill  with a  spoonful of coffee in advance. They are also  a snap to rinse clean. Now you can  use your Keurig machine guilt-free. Highly recommended.,20
positive,Perfect ! No issues,20
positive,Love it,20
positive,Good product.,20
negative,"I didn't see the no-handle part. What would be nice is if they listed the part # for a handle that fits for those of us who scan titles.<br />Above and beyond that, it's in pieces, with no instructions. So even if I do find a handle, I have no real instructions how to put it together. Now I'm smart, so I'll figure it out, but my husband looked at the pieces and said &#34;I'll wait for you to get home.&#34;",20
negative,"It's the last time I order a non-OEM filter, the darn thing floats out of it's receptacle so your coffee does not get filtered. I never had this problem with Braun filters.",20
positive,I liked that it was compatible for my refrigerator and at a reasonable price,20
positive,Thanks,20
positive,"So, when the element went out on my oven, I overhear my wife discussing the issue with my mother-in-law.  They had come to the conclusion that getting someone to replace this would be costly, and we should be looking at buying a new oven.  I'll always try to fix something if it can be safely done.  I usually go to a appliance parts place to get these sorts of things, but I think those guys have some inflated prices.  On a whim I checked Amazon...  thanks to Amazon Prime, I had the element in my hands in two days.  So, a total investment of two days, turning four screws to remove and replace the old element, and a total of about $20 spent, my oven is back in action.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Amazon Prime eligible (two days FREE shipping)<br />Perfect fit (easy replacement)<br /><br />Cons:<br />Wife might have liked a new oven....  ;-)",20
positive,I didn‚Äôt know what to expect but this magnetic dishwasher cover is stunning. I get so many compliments and I will be buying more. It fits exactly as described. Highly recommend!!,20
positive,Perfect replacement for a very reasonable price!,20
positive,"Thankfully, before I hooked it up and ran it.  I read the instructions  and watched a YouTube video on the brand. Both made it clear that due to the architecture of the machine it would sound different than other washers. They were right! Had I not done complete research before firing it up, I would have panicked because some of the sounds were horrendous , reminiscent of  a transmission grinding to a halt, or the sound of sawing wood with a hand saw!  I only noticed it during the beginning  of the maiden run because it was peculiar.  I found that due to the design, the agitator makes slow, small incremental moves both ways as it adds water at different  times during a cycle depending upon what it senses, as far as water level and balance.<br />  After the initial shock ,now that we know what to expect , its hardly noticeable.  The full operating sound level is very low.  We are in love with it. I was concerned because it was  six inches taller than our old 1990s washer and I was concerned about my wife having  difficulty reaching over the edge and into the bottom of the basket.  She reports no problem and the lid clears the shelf above the washer.  Happily she reports almost no difference but was very happy because she reports that for our two person household she usually did 6-8 loads of laundry a week r but today the same amount only too three loads.  we initially did a load of bath towels about twelve plus hand towels and there was no problem.<br />It starts rather slow and the green sensing light stays on until it decides there is no imbalance. Initially it seemed like a long time because you don't hear water gushing in right away.  YouTube  has a video about calibrating these models by turning the dial a few clicks. The instructions do not mention this but it appears to have no relevance so far.  She loves the fabric softener dispenser that is in the top of the agitator and a small bleach dispenser in the front left corner.  It certainly does a good job of spinning out water.  Things dry much quicker in our old 1990s electric dryer.<br />It was packed very well almost too well.  It would help to have two people to unpack it as the instructions show it set on its side to remove the cardboard pedestal.  I didn't do that and it was a bit of a struggle to get it out but did.",20
positive,Sooooo quiet - don‚Äôt even hear it!  Nicest little cooler ever !!!  Looks more expensive than it is !!,20
negative,Worked for a little over 2 months. Now it's dead. VERY disappointed!,20
positive,"A little small, but serves its purpose. It does NOT come with the exhaust hose (aluminum hose that connects from the machine to outside to let out hot air), so you‚Äôll need to buy that extra. Small machine, like I said, so it takes a minute to dry heavier loads.",20
positive,Great replacement for my dryers heating element,20
negative,Does the job but pricey..,20
negative,These filters must contain gold dust to be this expensive. But you got to have OEM stuff that works and no leaks.,20
positive,Much less expensive than the name brand.  Worked in my LG.,20
positive,"Absolutely love this coffee filter. Bought one and after using it bought for all my relatives as presents.  It makes good strong (at least for my taste) coffee, it is easy to clean, do not get clogged! i love it!",20
negative,"I bought this freezer more than a year ago. When we got it, we saw there was a very small gap on the top edge of the door, but I didn't pay much attention. But it turns out this tiny gap has been causing ice accumulation inside and often makes the door difficult to open. And it definitely doesn't have de-frost capability either, and recently half of all usable space was all filled with ice and my food was frozen in. As I have to unplug it to get the ice melted my food was spoiled more than once because of this.",20
negative,Would of gave 5 stars but crumbs stick to it . Oh well,20
positive,Easy to use and no cleaning after using these plates.,20
positive,Part worked great!! Fast delivery..,20
negative,"I give the unit 5 stars for looks, but when it's turned on the racket sounds like buck-shot rattling around in a metal can. Position 1) is fairly quiet, 2) and 3) sounds like someone trying to wrinkle up plastic packing.<br /><br />The installer told me that the noise is the two halves of the damper? /flapper banging around inside the 7 inch pipe. I suspect that the air flow at level 1) is only sufficient to move lightweight aluminum, a heaver material wouldn't open. The higher air flows causes the two halves to flutter / rattle in the pipe.<br /><br />The range surface is 21 inches from the filter screens. I tried a smoke test with a punk stick on the right front burner.<br />Setting 1) the smoke stream was hardly disturbed. 2) smoke started to move towards the screens but seemed to be effected by the return air from the outer top surface slits. 3) the smoke was definitely whisping towards the filter screens. My speaking voice was the same volume as the fan. At level 4) the noise and rattling was louder than normal speech, but the smoke was being sucked out. Guess I'll have to find a decibel meter to check the actual noise level.<br /><br />I did ask the salesman about a fan that had the motor in the attic, but the cost was excessive, so I bought the more economical Broan Allure.<br /><br />My final thoughts;<br /><br />If you don't like something change it, If you can't change it, change the way you think about it!<br /><br />Would I buy this model had I known about the sound, probably not.",20
negative,Not as good as original.,20
positive,"Received my Max Burton 6200 Induction Cooktop a week ago and so far I love it. It's a bit larger and taller than I expected but it has made me clean out my cabinets to accommodate it, so not a bad thing. This unit cooks extremely fast and so far I have NOT burned anything. I fried chicken for the first time in 15yrs and with 1/2 the oil you usually use it came out perfect and no mess to clean up. The only negative thing I can find about it so far is I wish I had a Settings Manual to guide me on which setting are best for which foods. I have Looked online and there is also nothing available. I would highly recommend this product for Rvs, boats, or anyone looking to save energy and never burn anything again!",20

positive,They were received before quoted date. Are working great. Will be ordering again.,20
negative,"Was expecting it to fit. came in two sheets, each was 23 inches. not a big deal right? so I have 2 inches seperating them in the center. Irritates me to no end. I have no idea why. Then when I got it, half the plastic was covering the flow lines at the top and the bottom. I tried it and couldnt get good flow so I spent an hour retooling it with a file to ensure it would flow better. I have one of lee's for my ten gal, works great. in my 75 gallon, it lacks. I ended up canning it after 2 weeks of fiddling. I have a 10, 20 and 75 gal. not my first rodeo, although it is 3 times the size of what I did have. I read everywhere online undergravel filtering is no good. I think I am done wasting my time. Some people swear by it, so compare the reviews and make your own choice. As for me, I say NAY!",20

negative,The package was delivered but as soon as we cut plastic straps the box came apart.  It was damp and bottom part of box seemed like it came apart then strapped.<br />We‚Äôll see how it works,20
negative,They don‚Äôt stay in the hole. We used foil to help.  Thought if glue but need heat resistance adhesive,20
positive,"Adhesive area is about three X three inches.. So toddler can not break.<br />looks and works good today , I received this piece",20
positive,Had my Thermador built in up and running in no time.  Service call would have taken a month to come.  this part and a few you tube videos from refrigeration techs saved the day,20
negative,The product itself works but I've noticed it takes more to heat up.  Our settings seem to be off 7/10 seems to be more like a 5-6/10.  Not sure if this is normal but has affect cooking temperatures.  It's good enough but not sure if there is wear in period.,20
positive,Works good,20
positive,PERFECT FIT,20
positive,Was going to buy a new dryer but thanks to Amazon was able to buy a $35 part and fix it.,20
positive,I loved this item. I had washed the original one that came with my microwave but it was such a pain. This was a 2pk for a great value. I will definitely order again.,20
positive,"The furnace vents in my house, like millions of others, have metal louvers that don't quite close. This allows some air to get through when the blower is running. That little bit of air causes an unpleasant &#34;wheeze&#34; and it drives me nuts when I'm trying to sleep. Additionally, I like my bedroom cold, unlike the rest of the house. So I installed one of these boots on the vent.<br />Unpacking the item takes a little patience - they're rolled up quite tightly and the tacky, folded rubber wants to stick to itself. Be patient and careful not to tear the material.<br />Once unfurled, just slip this thing onto the bottom side of the vent. Voila! Peace, quiet, and no air flow at last. Enjoy.",20

positive,Seems to be way easier clean and use. Rinses,20
negative,Washers on each wheel started rusting within 2 weeks. Swapped with stainless washes purchased for $1.75. The other components appear to be stainless (we‚Äôll see how long they last).,20
positive,"This combo isn't as big as I expected.  You would think there would be a lot more space because o the width of each unit, but these are actually not as deep as a typical fridge, which I think is fine, since stuff only gets lost way in the back, but I was a bit disappointed when they arrived. The interior storage space is also shorter, and sits up a bit higher, so it's only slightly more space than my previous refrigerator, and it is often still packed to the brim.  The door storage is nice as well, and that likely accounts for part of the reason that the shelves are shallower than most.<br />The full freezer is great space for us though. It does occasionally make a loud humming sound, which concerned me at first, but it was much worse in the beginning when it was cooling down.  Now I hardly ever hear it, I think it only does it if it needs to make a big temperature adjustment.<br />The ice bin is way too small, about the size of a shoe box. We have a scoop in there and it's barely enough room to scoop ice out without it spilling over the side.  I've been looking for a larger bin that I can put in there when we have company over. the ice bin does just sit on the top shelf, so if we do plan a party and will need lots of ice, we could just move the shelf down and put a large bucket there to gather a big quantity of ice.<br />We ordered the Trim Kit with it, but due to some construction issues with our tile floors, we still haven't been able to install it.  At the moment our freezer wobbles, but I'm sure we'll have that adjusted just fine when we get the trim kit professionally installed.",20

positive,Great space to organize food storage. Very please<br />With little refrigerator.,20
positive,When these started breaking in my whirlpool dishwasher I checked online to replace them and all I found were $20 and up each. I got a 4 pack for less than that. They snap right in place in minutes and work as well as the original rollers did. They look like they will last longer than the originals did because of the metal bushings that hold the wheels on seem sturdier than the plastic on the originals.,20

positive,Very happy with this product. Works like a charm!!,20
positive,Fit perfectly.  I saved a bundle over an appliance man replacing it.  Easy to replace.,20

positive,"I was skeptical about that effectiveness of the reusable K-cups but I have been pleasantly surprised. They are durable and my coffee still tastes great and is strong enough.

negative,"Had a horrible experience; returning it just before 1 month of usage which equals maybe 3 loads at best.<br /><br />1. The hose extension doesn't fully fit into a sink or whatever so the solution of many users online is to drape a towel over the sink extension so that the water just drips down instead of all over the place.<br />2. Washed perfectly for the first load and then afterwards, spin cycle doesn't work properly any more. Clothes came out completely drenched since the spin cycle is supposed to do that. Had to manually wring out the clothes that I had planned to wash.<br />3. Can't exactly tell what's wrong and no explanation as to what may be happening since the customer service line they have for the product have people who have no idea what they're talking about. They ask for an explanation several times as if they have an answer and then tell you that they don't have an answer. Then tells me to call the technician to come out and fix it.<br /><br />So considering this was supposed to make my life easier by having a washing machine in the house, it has seriously made my Sunday into an absolute hell trying to figure out what the heck is going on as well as wringing out clothes and towels.",20

positive,The actual critters (santa etc) are not nearly as bold and crisp as in the pictures.  Would say the colors and fabic blur together enough that I wasn't sure what it was on some.  No idea about the adhesive yet.,20
positive,"Works perfectly for my Vue, just what I needed and at a very good price!",20
negative,I attached it to the previous hose for the machine. It leaks but it drains outdoors so it's not a problem for me.,20
positive,"worked great,  good price",20
positive,Loved the quickness of delivery. I was able to have our dishwasher up and running in no time!,20
positive,This stuff is amazing!!!! Honestly! Bought a few bottles just in case I didn‚Äôt have enough to cover but one bottle does the job if your rack is just starting to rust. It‚Äôs awsome!,20
positive,Worked great !,20
positive,Saved over $300 compared to OE parts from the manufacturer website.,20
positive,OEM filters are twice as expensive and I can't tell a difference. I have used 2 of these so far,20
positive,The product was easily installed. Took 20 minutes to remove old one and install new one. Oven heated up without issue.,20
positive,"This purifier is great and serves its purpose wonderfully. The best part is, you can't find one cheaper that does this great of a job. We bought it to try and fix the water flow on our fridge. The water stream was coming out very slow and was a very small stream. When we replaced our purifier with this one, the water flow was instantly better. The water came out a lot faster and thicker.",20
negative,"Arrived quickly and unharmed. The installation was too complicated for me, so I hired an expert who charged me a pretty penny for the installation. It was working great for the first few months but one day while I was changing the filter on my unit I noticed it was not working any more. Not sure when it exactly died on me, but it died.  Not planning on replacing it since it's so expensive on the professional installation. Can't say if I recommend it or not since I can't think of the real reason why it died.",20
positive,"It was so easy to install, I watch a utube video and changed it I myself with javing to wait on husband",20
negative,Worked great for about 2 months now my coffee maker doesn't recognize them all the time. Very frustrating at 4am,20
positive,Perfect replacement fit.  nothing bad to say about them at all other than original quality broke too easy that I needed to buy this in the 1st place to replace the OEM version.,20
positive,Perfect in our RV,20
positive,"I could not wait to put these to use, so as soon as they were delivered they went right up! The quality is great, and they fit the refrigerator and oven door handles perfectly. I didn‚Äôt even know these kind of decorations were a thing. Who would‚Äôve thought to dress up your refrigerator handles?! Genius! They‚Äôve gotten so many compliments since they‚Äôve been on. Definitely loving these!",20
positive,Awesome price,20
positive,FITS LG PERFECTLY,20
positive,"I was debating whether to try this on my rfg298aars which was flashing 5 times (low voltage) but then I saw a review confirming that it worked for rfg297 and both, this model and mine, use the same inverter model, so I decided to take the chance and try it out. Sure enough, it worked like a charm and I am hoping this gives my fridge a new life",20
positive,Clean  water,20
negative,Never buy it again send us broking one,20
negative,It was okay because it is a filter. I don't compare similar products. I guess it does meet my expectations.,20
positive,This oven element fit our 10 year old oven perfectly. It was easy to install and it works well. I was a little worried not going with the Whirlpool brand but this price was so good in comparison that I had to give it a try. Glad I did.,20
positive,"This was really easy to install and took me all of 10 or so minutes.  Most of that was spent wrestling with my drier hose.  Since the air is already being vented into the laundry room there's no issue.  When summer comes around I may have to take the product off.  The unit itself has gaps in the plastic.  I may have my husband seal it with some caulking or we may just remove it in the warmer weather.<br /><br />Since we live in such an arid climate this product is perfect!  It keeps the back of the house warm while the drier is going and adds much needed humidity to the air.  In climates that aren't a desert I'd be cautious, as it does put out a good amount of humidity.<br />I don't feel as bad using the drier rather than my drying rack while using this product.",20
positive,These work very well and saved me a boatload of money!,20
positive,"Cooking is fast and precise, the only drawback is the controls do not like to get wet, and might react with the liquid as if you are touch them.  If that happens I recommend using the Lock feature on the controls.<br /><br />Install was very simple because we replaced an existing electric cooktop and made sure measurements were correct before buying.",20
positive,Easy to install. Quickly makes a lot of ice. I've had it several months now and it works great. Hopefully it will continue to do so. I'll try to update the review if or when it starts to have problems.,20
negative,"I'm disappointed with this induction range. I had hoped with the good rating their next higher level model had from Consumers Reports, that this would be a good choice.<br />When the induction works, it is one of the best cooking experiences I've ever had. My biggest issue is that I can't really use any induction-ready pan with a base smaller than  6 inches in diameter. I even bought  a highly rated stainless steel hob and it causes the cooktop to overheat faster than it works to heat up my smaller pans. The placement of the smaller induction burner in the back, immediately in front of the controls means I risk burns trying to make changes when I'm using my bamboo steamer on top of a stainless steel pan.<br />I was surprised that it works well with a couple of my cheaper frying pans. However, I was disappointed that my trusty Lodge cast iron griddle/grill pan won't work with both FlexCook burners. I purchased this model especially because of the FlexCook option.<br />I also wish I'd been able to see the back of the range before I purchased it. We paid an electrician to install the proper connection, but it's sticking so far out that the range is pushed three inches out from the wall. If I'd been able to see the back, I would've known to have them install it much lower.<br />The oven is wonderful. It heats up quickly and so far everything I've baked has turned out great.<br />I do not recommend this model.",20
negative,Do not order. Faulty product. Cheap. Shipped in newspaper in an envelope. It was bent and unusable on arrival.,20
positive,"I saw these on another website for $30 and typed the part number into Amazon and found them for $10. They showed up the next day and it took less than 10 minutes to replace. Removed the front panel, removed the two screws on the bracket holding the solenoids in place, slid the old ones out, new ones in and two screws back in place. Fired right up and back in business. This was on Whirlpool model GGW9200LW0.",20
positive,Work,20
positive,I'm trying them now. They seem to be doing a good job. They were easy to install.,20
positive,"Compact, versatile, light weight, easy to use, instructions printed right on the bag.<br />Even after squeezing/draining clothes are still pretty wet, but wrapping/wringing in a quick-dry towel left them just damp to touch - about the same as my heavy duty front load washer, but in a fraction of the time.<br />4 Stars because the nylon storage bag came with a big hole in the bottom (seam stitching missed one side of the fabric.)<br />Great Customer service! They replaced the whole thing within 2 days of contacting them.<br />RECOMMENDED",20
negative,I have been unable to use this because the LR1130 batteries last only a few hours.  I don't know if this is because the thermometer is defective or if the batteries are defective.,20
positive,Excelente,20
positive,"I love these things, I like to connect them to an array of LEDs that light up as the temp goes up. Haven't had a single issue with them and they're super easy to use.",20
positive,Ice making was quick and the set up was easy!,20
negative,This is the second time I have had to replace this item. My husband and I are empty nesters. We do not overload the door shelves in our refrigerator. Every single one has been replaced and this particular one had to be replaced a second time after only 9 months. Personally I think the design is poor. I could say more about the brand it serves but I won't. Lets see how long this one last.,20
negative,"The diameter was not 4"" so it wouldn't go over the dryer outlet or attach to the wall.",20
positive,Worth to buy these filters.,20
positive,Like having backups ready,20
positive,Fit just right for replacement in my coffee pot.,20
positive,Our heated dry wasn‚Äôt working on our dishwasher. We tried several different things that didn‚Äôt work. BUT THIS FIXED IT! Great purchase,20
positive,"shipping was a little slow, but finally got here.. it looks durable and well made..  fits my kitcheaid K45 what else can I say...<br />its the part that made the whole mixer come together...",20
positive,"A few years ago we found a fancy red GE washer that someone had placed out for bulk trash pickup. It looked like it was not used very much, and had been stored for years. A rodent chewed a hole in the drain pipe. I fixed it with a 10 dollar part, cleaned it up and we have been using it for years.<br /><br />Some time ago it started banging when it would spin.  We would have to load smaller loads to prevent the banging.  I saw these shocks for really low price without any reviews, and gave them a shot.<br /><br />Had them installed in less than 15 mins and the banging is gone. Turns out only 2 of the 4 were bad. I replaced all 4 and kept the 2 good old ones as spares.<br /><br />The supplied pins did not fit so I reinstalled the original pins. All is well. I would purchase again.<br /><br />Believe it or not, a year after we found the red washer, the same folks had put the matching dryer at the curb. Same slightly used/stored condition.  It had a broken/chewed wire that I repaired.",20
negative,Terrible. Did not fit my refrigerator correctly and damaged my ice maker as it no longer works.,20
positive,"Every few months Whirlpool sends me a reminder to buy another water filter for my KitchenAid refrigerator. This purchase saves me money & since I have this purchase automatic, I don‚Äôt even have to think about it ü•≥",20
positive,"I bought this for a Maytag dishwasher that is approx. 10 years old. It runs perfectly as we have taken good care of it, but the basket was being eaten away by the abrasive nature of dishwasher detergent. I measured the old basket and ordered based on the size and the quality of reviews I read.<br />It fits like a glove and has a lid with slots for individual pieces of silverware. If I decide I don't want the slots, that part can be removed. So far, it has worked very well. The cost was approx. $40, but this is a durable piece of equipment and probably will not have to be replaced for many years, I hope. I think it's a good buy.",20
positive,Great freezer. No dents at all,20
negative,"I had to ream out the bushing with a >500 reamer before it would slide into place. Its diameter was also a little larger, although I don't think it makes any difference. Its in, working and so far no trouble.",20
negative,"I have ordered this exact product several time for my refrigerator; however my most recent order the top spout of the filter is completely different and does NOT match my unit.  In my photos, the new filter is on the right, the older one on the left.  Totally different and new does not fit",20
negative,Don‚Äôt buy!!  Terrible replacement filter for Samsung. Purchased this 1 month ago. Exactly 1 month I found water pouring out of my fridge and flooding my kitchen. Opened the fridge door and was coming from the filter area. Removed the filter and saw large crack down the side of filter. Not sure if this generic brand uses cheap plastic or what. Of course it cracked 1 month later (1 day out of return policy). I was away on vacation the day before. Had I not been home this would have been thousands of dollars of water damage.,20
positive,Works very well. Good looking and nice to lookout.,20
positive,"I like the price, efficiency and looks. Only dislike is that it is heavy and needs two healthy people for installation. Overall a great product and price which is unbeatable.",20

positive,Great product delivered timely,20
negative,I wanted to like this cook top but how can I hook up the gas line? The manufacturer and Amazon can't figure it out. I know.it takes a British pipe thread adapter but how do you seal the adapter to the pipe? So I returned it,20
positive,quick shipping,20
positive,Excellent,20
negative,I don't know why I even gave this product two stars. I have ordered filters through Amazon before and have received  the same sturdy ones I always used. These were flimsy and didn't last long since they  wouldn't hold up.,20
positive,"This was a great replacement for our less attractive (white) Kenmore hood once we bought all new stainless appliances. The 3-stage lighting is beautiful and though the lights do put off some heat, it's not enough to warrant finding cooler bulbs that don't look nearly as nice.<br /><br />The Advanced Heat Sentry system that automatically turns on the fan when it senses an abundance of heat can easily be disconnected so you don't have to tolerate the noise during dinner/conversation (it's pretty obvious which cable to unhook from the &#34;motherboard&#34;). You may or may not want to do this depending on your cooking style/location of hood in relation to dinner table or conversation area. The fan can run for a while until the cooktop/oven area has cooled which can be pretty annoying if you want peace and quiet with your meal - there's no way to turn it off yourself unless you disconnect the sensor. Word of caution: the manufacturer suggests that the AHS system can prolong the life of the hood, so decide for yourself if you want to turn off this feature by disconnecting the sensor.<br /><br />Installation wasn't too bad for a 1-man job since I was replacing a ducted hood to begin with. If you take your time to perfectly measure where the hanging screws go, it's going to make your life a lot easier.<br /><br />Overall, a great compliment to your existing stainless appliances that will give you excellent exhaust and a nice updated look.",20
positive,Have made multiple orders of these. Works very well.,20

negative,I bought a Thor in Oct 2016. Not sure about it. From start left back burner has never functioned. Now knob to left front falls off. The oven itself does not regulate temperature - had thermometer register 500 degrees when set on 350. No one seems to know where I can get this thing fixed.,20

positive,Right item,20
negative,"Size was good for my floor registers, but the corner registers were oddly shaped and these didn't fit (not their fault, but they're not flexible enough to bend over a corner). One real gripe - they're not that strong magnetically. They cover the vent, but come off pretty easily if bumped or if your furnace/AC has a higher air flow. Wishing these had a little more magnetism so they would stick tightly.",20
positive,This just arrived yesterday. .  This holds much more then I thought it would. Also it cleans very well. I had a Haier before and this is so much better.<br />I kept my Haier for 1 month and sent it back.  This washer spins the clothes so much better and rinses better then the Haier.  This is just a great washer and a great price.  Duncan,20

After many many conversations with (outsourced) customer service over a period of several months nothing was done. Almost 8 months after purchase, new parts were mailed and a technician was sent. Technician told us the parts were not going to solve the problem and we needed to ask for a refund.  At this point my wife is sick and tired of communicating with this companies customer service (8 months!) and I have little hope for any happy ending here. Almost ready to eat the 2 grand and throw it through their front window. I'm kidding I can't lift it. Anyhow, its a beautiful stove if it works properly but good luck getting a resolution if it doesn't.",20

You have two options: 1) drill the pin with a 1/8 bit and then put a screw into that hold and pull the pin out. 2) Push the pin further into the support until it passes into the foam and remove the support. Option 1 is optimal as it causes no damage to the foam surrounding the fridge. To install, align the shelf support and push the round pin in until it is flush.",20

negative,"Let me start by saying I ordered an OEM pair of these from Parts Dr. at 9.99 per. 20 dollars folks, apparently that's what the set of these costs if your contractor happens to run off with your access panel during install to never return. Furthermore, my OEM access panel was such a snug fit that I physically couldn't exert the pressure to tighten these into a locked state on top of it - they just kept turning and popping out. In the end, some cheap and sturdy zip ties made quick and clean looking work of an area of an appliance where people generally won't waste time staring at, so frankly I'd recommend grabbing a bag of those for five bucks over any absurdly priced twist clip junk such as the item shown here.",20

I'm grudgingly giving 2 stars because it worked for two years before the coating visibly came off in the ice cubes.

Toughest part was taking off the door.  But even that wasn't too hard.  Release the rails with 2 clips and Bob's your uncle.  Just a little awkward because of its size.  Get a helper.

But they do stay put when you set them up. I had them a long time and it was my fault. I will buy them again if I have to because they really help in keeping the area between my stove and counter clean and from crumbs falling through onto the floor.<br />These work great. They were a bit long but very easy to cut for a perfect fit. When they get dirty I just take them over to the sink and wash with soap and water. So much better than trying to clean between the stove and my cabinet which is a very tight fit and almost impossible to clean. I can't even see these gap covers because my stove is black.

negative,"It is a good fit for my dishwasher, it is easy to install but the wheels broke off in just couple of months. Unfortunately, I am not able to find anything better.",20
negative,Failed on the 30th day. Just after return ended.,20
positive,This definitely gets the job done. My only complaint is that it's a little hard to clean if you don't run it through the dishwasher after every use. I like being able to use my own coffee instead of K-cups.  So far this has worked out pretty well for me.,20
negative,"They did not even have a box, just lose in a plastic bag. Who knows what they are. Strange. Almost like they were used. Not good. DO NOT BUY.",20
positive,Good price and quality.,20
positive,"I love my AeroPress and I've been using paper filters ever since I got it a few years ago. Then one day it occurred to me that maybe there's a reusable version. This is it, and it's great! It's as easy to use as the paper filter, and there's no waste. I can detect no difference in my coffee's taste. There is a very small, practically miniscule, amount of grounds/sludge at the bottom of my cup. It's more than with the paper filter, but less than if you make coffee from a French press. The two biggest differences between this filter and the paper filter are: 1) be careful because in the beginning you might accidentally throw your new filter away if you're used to pushing the paper puck into the trash, and 2) when you throw away the puck using this filter, you'll have to scrape a small residue of coffee grounds into the trash manually.",20
negative,"It did not fit properly and was advertised to be a replacement part for my exact part number,<br />I ordered the two pack and it as NOT the exact size of the part number I ordered from. I spent $50 for two just in case I had on break again, while trying to put the first one on, because it wasn‚Äôt a perfect fit, and broke ad we tried to install it. We put the second one in the freezer so it contracted a little.  We managed to get the second one installed but it still does not fit properly. This is not an exact match for Frigidair. I would not recommend this for replacement.",20
negative,I was really hopeful this would work however when I went to install it the threads broke. I wish I could get another but they didn‚Äôt give an option for that. Hopefully I just got a bad one but not sure,20
positive,I loved the idea where the split auto flips up when the level of eggs are gone‚Ä¶had to get one.<br /><br />This is until I received it‚Ä¶disappointment sets in‚Ä¶<br /><br />Due to the height of the egg holder‚Ä¶if you are to place the holder in the door of the fridge‚Ä¶<br /><br />- you are only able to refill the eggs while the holder is in the fridge‚Ä¶because the holder in the fridge door is not a flat in/out‚Ä¶it has that lip so things don‚Äôt fall out when you open/close the fridge‚Ä¶that means when you place the holder in the fridge door‚Ä¶you will need to tilt the holder‚Ä¶resulting the holder must be empty while filling with eggs<br /><br />- if you find tilting the egg holder or filling the holder with eggs with the fridge door open an annoyance and decide to place it inside the fridge‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a bit tall‚Ä¶it‚Äôs doable but not ideal<br /><br />- if you are lucky enough to have a larger fridge where you have one of those pockets in the door where it‚Äôs deeper‚Ä¶due to the eggs being fragile‚Ä¶I wouldn‚Äôt dare to open/close the fridge too hard being afraid the eggs will fall off the holder<br /><br />All in all‚Ä¶great idea‚Ä¶quality is ok for the price‚Ä¶but definitely room for improvements.,20
positive,"Best thing ive purchased in a while!<br />I dont have a ice machine in my freezer so this is nice to be able to fill it up with water and have ice for a drink in less then 10 minutes!  Definitely better then using the ice trays and trying to make room for them in the freezer and having to wait hours, when this is quick and easy.<br />The ice machine itself is built better then i thought it would be, pretty solid machine! Definitely recommend getting it!",20
positive,Very good,20

positive,Great,20
negative,"Worked well for just over a year. Then it started being noisy while operating. About 2 weeks later, it just makes noise and doesn‚Äôt work. Mind you, it‚Äôs been doing Landry for a family with five kids, so your mileage may vary.<br /><br />Will update my review if I can rebuild it.",20
positive,"Works well. Once you find the *right* one of the three, that's it; it's all you'll ever use again, and it's never going to wear out or break.",20
negative,It isn't very reliable with temperature but does keep things cold. I received this product damaged as well. Made of cheap metal but if you just keep small drinks and such this is and okay product. I've had it for almost a year and it hasn't broken yet either!,20
positive,It worked perfectly,20
positive,"I'm impressed with this company, their customer service, and well put together documentation that makes set-up easy. Love the QR codes on back of temp/humidity sensors that make set up a breeze. I set up the Hub wirelessly in 5 minutes. I'm using one temp sensor on my back porch next to my juniper bonsai so I know how cold it gets at night. When it drops below 30 degrees F outside, I'll move juniper into my detached unheated garage for better protection. I'm using a 2nd temp sensor in garage simutaneously so I can monitor temperature difference. I want the plant to spend as many nights around 40 degrees as possible. The Hub package w/2 temp sensors is extremely affordable compared to other brands that charge $99 alone for their  Hub. The YoLink Hub accommodates 300 YoLink device connections. Already connected a YoLink leak sensor behind my washing machine. The 3 sensors + 1 Hub all display on the app's home screen so I can monitor at a glance. Some reviews mentioned set-up was challenging, but it was easy.",20
positive,"Works great, thanks!",20
negative,"I had cut it way down to size so it won‚Äôt be in the way of the flames and it still burned. Also the material is like some kind of fiberglass. the parts that I cut off actually got stuck to my skin and cut me, made me bleed. So you get what you paid for. Would NOT recommend this to anyone!!!",20
negative,Wrong rollers/glides No lubrication,20
negative,I found this and every other K-Cup very poor.  It does not provide anywhere close to the strength of the actual pre-filled k-cups.  I was using 3 of these PER cup that i could use the k-cups.  I also don't think its the coffee either- I was using the same coffee in re-fillable pods with my old Senseo.,20
positive,Got it ontime (in think) replaced it and got my dishwasher back working - Not draining issue resolved.,20
positive,It works! and super easy to install !,20
positive,I contacted GE about getting a replacement part for something that was missing. They said to deal with Amazon.  So no support from GE<br />Had this unit for a while. It sounds like a cat that is dying after it‚Äôs been running a while.  Makes great ice but if you get three or four glasses of ice it definitely will be doing the dying cat noise before all the ice is filled back up,20
negative,Broke after only 3months,20
negative,"Today I opened up the Deflecto Dryer Duct Cleaning Kit and got right to work. I screwed it onto the first rod and hooked it up to the drill and seem to work just fine. I was a little worried how it would handle to 90 degree turn, but it worked just fine. It began to go down hill after the turn. Somewhere about 7-8 feet up the first rod either snapped or came unscrewed. Now I have to figure out how to get the brush and rod out from the pipe. Not happy at all.",20
negative,This was supposed to fit my fridge. It did not. Missed the return window because my fridge was broken for a month. Out $50!,20

positive,Great replacement,20
positive,Good price.  Peace of mind for bursting without installing separate on/off valve.,20

positive,Perfect fit. Just like original. On time.,20
negative,Didn't fit,20
negative,ice maker was defective  had to return did not reorder,20
positive,none,20
positive,Just what I've been looking for at less than 1/2 the cost found elsewhere.  It seems a bit warped but a heavy pot flattens it right out.  It's nice to have an element on that burner again.  The other one broke and although I don't use it all that much it was a rather unsightly hole.,20
positive,Absolutely Love this<br />Living in a trailer we could not have water dispenser so we only had small ice machine when this showed up it was more than I could imagine. Absolutely awesome so my customer I was telling him about was so impressed I ordered one for his birthday next week ü•∞,20
positive,"I was skeptical to buy this given the reviews; however, to my surprise the part came with 6 plastic wear tabs and fit perfectly. Washer is spinning like it should.",20
positive,Used in the room humidfier,20
positive,Ease of purchase in maintaining my fridge.,20
positive,This product saved me a lot of money and time.  I was able to have my oven up and running 15 minutes after receiving this part,20
positive,Easy to install. Great value. Still working great!,20
positive,"This stopped the leak I was having with my dishwasher; it is half the price of the other competitors out there. Make sure to watch a video of how to install, it is slightly tricky depending on your dishwasher.",20
positive,worked well on my LG,20
positive,"Product does not ""snap"" into position and will fall out as you install it.  Others I have tried snapped into position.  However, once in place, hold it in place and as you close the housing, the unit fits firmly in place.",20
positive,Great price!  Works perfectly!,20
negative,"I really needed this ice maker and I was happy that it came very fast, it worked for 3 days and was great, but then it started shutting off, saying it was full when it was not even half full, or just shutting off for no reason, and Im lucky if I get 2-3 cups of ice a day. It makes me very sad, it is not worth buying.  '' update'' yesterday and today it has NOT made any ice at all. I am pissed, DONT BUY THIS GARBAGE",20
positive,Works great. Got handfuls of stuff out,20
positive,Just what I wanted,20
positive,came very quick and worked great will order again when needed,20
positive,Just as pictured. Super easy installation & it works!,20
positive,"Fit perfectly,  I am now able to use the k-cup pods with my Vue keurig machine.  Keurig has decided not to make the Vue coffee maker anymore, so I was left with a machine that was obsolete. Fortunately, this little device allows me to buy k-cups anywhere.  There has been no spilling of grinds into coffee and I am able to use regular ground coffee if I desire!",20
negative,If I could give this product zero stars I would. If purchasing for anything over 100lbs do not buy. I purchased it to move my washer back and forth but once I placed my 200lb washer on top the rods bent and kept coming out of place no matter how many times it was fixed. The thing is so flimsy the moment I finally was able to move it around my washer fell off and scratched my wooden floors. Seller should change the deceitful descriptions of weight capacity and maneuverability. Please don‚Äôt waste your money.,20
negative,One of the two we ordered did not work.  Return was easy.,20
positive,"Admittedly a bit pricey for such a simple plastic piece, but it is what it is. A male to male 6 inch duct coupling. These plastic ones are useful where metal ducting goes outside the building envelope, to reduce the easy thermal pathway that a full-metal coupling would provide. If you have all metal ducts and a metal vent cover outside the building (which I prefer, because the plastic ones fall apart in UV light), you're just shuttling heat outside (in the winter), even with a damper/backdraft flap.<br /><br />To respond to another of the reviews left, this is absolutely the correct size for a *male* 6 inch coupling. If he found it was useless to connect to anything else, then he was trying to mate male to male. Not the product's fault.",20

negative,I've had my Samsung DV448 dryer and as many of the other reviews have stated have had a major lint problem.  The unit worked fine for 3 years and now has started to fail quiet often.  First to go was the tension wheel that keeps the drive belt tight.  One day it started making a grinding and squealing sound.  When I removed to exhaust duct to gain access to the underside of the drum the entire area was coated in a thick layer of lint.  I wrapped the exhaust tube with high temp metal tape to help seal the junction better and that seemed to help.  About 3 weeks later the heater element died.  I chose to replace the whole heater assembly instead of just the coils so I wouldn't have to pull it out in 3 more weeks to replace a thermostat sensor.  Like I said before I've had this unit for just over 3 years and believe this is way too many failures in such a short time.,20
positive,"I can't give a replacement part five stars, because it had to be replaced to begin with.  The part was exactly what my washer needed.  I had to re-seat the cable once and now it is happily earning its value in not having to go to the laundromat.  As others have said, retain the mounting screws from the original.  Additionally, it's worth it to track down the installation manual.  The metal retention clips required pliers to free the failed latch cable, as well as the push-in hanging hook.  Remember to take off the (in the Whirlpool Cabrio) wire block plate from the back.<br /><br />For those who did what I did first and tried to fix the innards of this, there are two bright metal strips bent in a couple places which came loose from I don't know where, and that is what failed.  They didn't look like they would attach anywhere, so maybe they are loose metal bits in the first place, but I never found where they go.  My time is eventually worth something, so buy one of these and save yourself electrocution, frustration, and annoyance.  There is a useful electric motor in the broken part if you fancy electronics scavenging.",20
negative,"now ordering my 3rd replacement evap fan for my cafe frig (2015) CYE22TSHSS.  Not sure if the fans are bad or is there something else going on.  Can buy the fan for 30 bucks and avoid tech visit for hundreds.  Will try to get amazon to let me return it, but not hopeful.<br />UPDATE:  the fan is noisy at times, but it seems to be working, but the connector is faulty.  I touched it and it started working, so left it alone and it has been working for several days now.  Will follow up if needed later.",20
positive,came on time and worked very well,20
negative,poorly made - does not unravel - difficult to lay flat,20
positive,Thank you so much for this product. It fit right in around the dishwasher. All I had to do was press it in and trim a little off. I thought I would have to buy a new dishwasher because it was leaking so badly before. This item saved me hundreds of dollars!,20
positive,These are great.  I bought a new K575 Keurig pot and these work perfectly with our &#34;own&#34; coffee.,20
positive,"Fits perfectly, works as it should.  Easy install.",20
positive,"I use this to replace the one I can no longer find, the quality feels like the old one and works just as well.",20
positive,I was amazed that I was able to find the right part that I needed to fix my dryer at a good price,20
positive,Great price and easy to install in my dryer. Worked as expected and I would recommend this product to anyone who needs it. Unsure if this is the part you need? Measure across you existing thermal fuse using the continuity setting on your voltage meter. If there is no continuity chances are you need to replace the part.,20
positive,Exactly as described...,20
positive,Not much to say...it is a great replacement for the part I lost.  Works great.,20

positive,Fixed the problem with my dishwasher!,20
positive,Best way to get coffee from the bag to the pod with no mess!,20
positive,"This ice maker is awesome.  We use it with our RV trailer and it really cranks out lots of ice fast.  If you forget to remove the ice, it will simply melt and make into more ice.",20
positive,easy part to change and fits perfect,20

negative,"These covers were flimsy, did not hold their shape nor did they resemble the curved covers in the pictures or diagram. They would not lay flat and were not shiny as noted in the picture.  Very disappointing product.  Wish I had read the reviews before I purchased.",20
positive,Original tray had developed stains from water dripping on it and would not get clean.  The price from Whirlpool was prohibitive considering the age of our refrigerator and this replacement is exactly the same as the original.  It snapped in the same and the thickness appears to be the same also. I plan on ordering  the parts that trigger the ice and the water because they have also not aged well.,20
positive,Awesome delivery,20

positive,"I purchased this item about a year ago and apparently was using too fine a grind. Yes, it got clogged. I contacted the company via e mail and received a very prompt reply about using the correct grind and how to unclog by soaking in Oxy Fresh/boiling water and/or running through dishwasher. I tried the Oxy Fresh route and it unclogged it about 75-80%. My contact, Julie offered to send me a new one free of charge since they value customer service to the utmost. I accepted the offer heartily and vowed to use coarse grind from now on! I received the new filter promptly.<br /> I have 2 full mugs each morning so I intend to give it the Oxy Fresh cleaning from time to time. I used to use a French Press but wanted something easier to clean. I highly recommend this cone filter since it gives a good cup of coffee and cleans easily and I would want to support a company that gives such wonderful customer service!",20
negative,Welp... this didn't work. Unless you have the screw pitcher lid this thing is designed for it's just a disaster waiting to happen. Bought this to go in my Mason jars so I can cold/vacuum brew but the lid for this is a joke. It couldn't hold on in a stiff breeze. If it tipped over the lid would fall off faster than a drunk granny on a greasy yoga ball.<br />It only held about 80 grams of drip ground coffee. Don't judge me I like my cold brew stronger than hercules and 5 times as dark. It's too much hassle to send back so the seller wins this round.<br />Maybe I'll find a way to make it a coffee strainer. LoL. Seriously don't buy this unless you get their pitcher. You'll be upset.,20
positive,not too noisy but you can definately hear it and seems to run a bit even when not used so may melt and recycle more than i thought but overall its a great little unit,20
positive,Small dryer but it is effective for small spaces.,20
positive,It took me a minute to figure out how to get this to fit in my Keurig Elite. I suggest anyone struggling youtube it and there is a very quick tutorial on there. It fits and works great so far. I will update my review if anything changes.,20

I the press on the light calcium(?) deposits to remove them. Rinsing gently to remove and embedded deposits. Now ready for use they are the installed. I generally get a season, which is about 5 months, from the set of 4. Oh, I do you Best Air's water treatment & bacteriostat combo product each filling",20

negative,Stopped lifting ice cubs. Made ticking nosie,20
negative,"So far it's great. Been using it a couple days with no issue. I thoroughly cleaned it when I received it, waited an hour as it said in the directions, plugged it in, filled it with water, pressed start and it took off. The only issue I have is the ice does stick together a little. They say to change the size of your cubes but I'm not sure how. Will update if anything goes south<br />Edit: last night (December 17th, 2022) the ice machine started leaking from the bottom. The seal is in and I have no idea where it's leaking from and so I can't keep ice in it obviously. Very upset about it. Less then 6 months of minimal use and I can no longer use it.",20
positive,I have used My-Cap products before and this did not dissapoint.  I recently purchased a Nespresso Virtuo and like to use my own coffee blend.

I definately will continue to purchase this.  Still a good product.,20

positive,Fit perfect.,20
negative,"This is the most annoying dyer I've ever owned. The obnoxiously loud beeping every few minutes when the clothes is dry is only the beginning of the problems (at least you can shut that off!). The ONLY setting on the dryer that is not high heat is the PermPress setting. And the sensor is set very wrong on that setting. It never ever dries anything on the first run. I've had to run it at least twice (and sometimes 3-4 times) to get it to dry my clothes. It is extremely annoying when you're doing several loads of laundry in one day. I know that it is not a matter of the sensor being gunky, I don't use dryer sheets and the sensor works fine on the cotton/high heat setting.  Now, to top the list of annoying things...after only 18 months the thermostat has blown out. I dried a load of towels last night and the entire machine and the load of towels became extremely hot and it smelled like burning electrical parts. Now today it runs but does not heat. From what I understand, Bosch only stands behind their products for 1 year so it looks like we'll either be paying a big fix it bill or getting a new dryer. Don't waste your money. You will hate this dryer and equally awful matching washer. Never buying their inferior products again!",20

The style was great but I could not get pass how horrible it looked.  I did not even plug it up.  I just put it back in the bos and returned it.,20

Until companies are forced to make k-cups totally compostable, which a few have done, separating the plastic cup from the filter and grounds is messy and time consuming.  This tool doesn‚Äôt cut through the filter so I still have to use a knife or scissors to cut it off.  Not a clean operation.",20

negative,"I purchased this as a stocking stuffer for Christmas 2021, and the recipient reports that it does, in fact, work as advertised.<br /><br />I had purchased several of this item many years ago and they worked flawlessly back then, so I was hopeful, despite the negative Amazon reviews.  I was prepared to assist the gift recipient in fixing or replacing the ends if they lacked sufficient grip, but again, I'm told they do work just fine.  Perhaps the manufacturer paid attention to the bad reviews and fixed the issue.<br /><br />The body of this tool is still just one solid piece of plastic, so the hinge has a limited life span.  If they had used a metal spring hinge, this thing would last just about forever, hence why they did not use a spring hinge.<br /><br />This tool is now WAY overpriced for a simple, small chunk of plastic and a couple of rubber caps.  The ones I purchased locally years ago only cost about $1.50 a piece, and even that's overpriced, considering the relatively short lifespan of the product.<br /><br />If yours doesn't work for you, there are fixes.  If cleaning and scuffing the tips with 100-150 grit sandpaper doesn't do the trick, you can replace them with automotive vacuum line caps, which are available in many sizes at most auto stores and the rubber is usually quite grippy.  I've even heard of people replacing the tips with pencil eraser-caps.<br />However, if they are now shipping units that are all identical to the one I bought for Christmas, the tips will work out of the box and you won't need to fix them.<br /><br />I deducted 2 stars due to it being ridiculously overpriced, because the plastic hinge is designed to have a short life span.",20
positive,It works and fits my unit.,20
positive,Seems like a good filter.  Water tastes fine.,20
positive,Gr8 prod & outstanding price n shpng. The part came within time specified. Put unit 2gether and I had heat again. Thanks.,20
positive,"My fridge got warm and the freezer was icing up.  The fan would not turn properly. I ordered this evaporator motor and after installing it, my fridge works fabulously.  It's a great motor.  I highly recommend it.<br /><br />One little tip: When swapping out your  motor, make sure to remove the silicone bushings from the front and back of your old motor, place them on the new motor and then install.",20

positive,Loud but works great!!!!,20
positive,"I really do like the ice this machine makes.<br />It is clear ice.<br />It does recycle the melted ice , which I thought it didn't, but IT DOES!<br /><br />Not quite as fast as advertised but it does make a good amount of ice per day.<br /><br />You just need to stay on top of emptying out the tray as it stops making ice when full.",20

negative,"[[VIDEOID:a808b5c30c7589faf49c03a7f1bc89c4]] Best if you have hard and smooth surface, and have limited storage space.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- This dolly can be retracted to fit in a small box .<br />- You can adjust the length of the dolly.<br />- You can adjust the distance between the dolly.<br />- Low, so it is much easier to slip under the appliance like washers<br />- Awesome to move washers/driers<br /><br />Cons<br />- It will not work on carpet or rough surface.  Wheels are too small for tall carpet.<br />- Small wheel means it is a harder to roll if you are use to big wheels<br />- Also, it is hard to roll if you place a heavy item on the rails<br />- To turn, you have to turn around center of gravity (i.e. spin turn).  Traverse, spin, and traverse, instead of steer.  Traverse is a one-man move, but spin turn may need two people.<br /><br />Picture of normal dolly and washing machine dolly are taken side by side.  If you are moving washer/drier, this is it.  They are so much easy to slip under.  The use as a general purpose dolly is more limited, compared to a normal dolly, since the wheels are much smaller.",20

negative,"Worked great for 5 months. Then died. The warranty process and service is abysmal. They try to make it as painful (and expensive, mind you) a process as possible until you decide that it's worth neither the hassle nor the expense to get it replaced.<br /><br />Stay away from this manufacturer.",20
positive,"My regular load in my Whirlpool Duet Mod GEW9250PW1 were taking an hour or longer. I replaced this fuse and cut my drying time to almost half. I did it because it went out, but I wish I did it sooner. Fit was right for my model. I have also had to replace the other fuse and the heating coil in the past, this piece made the most difference in drying times. (unless you want to be sarcastic and say that without he heating coil there is no drying, but I digress) Also, I found a youtube video on how to do this, it was trying to convince the watcher that you have to disassemble the ENTIRE dryer, NOT TRUE. It was EASILY done through the bottom panel. (I have the drawer underneath raising the dryer which makes it easier) Small ratchet and maybe some pliers to pull the wires. Lastly, while you have everything apart (and unplugged) get a vacuum and such and clean it out, that will help it be more efficient as well. Worth the price.",20
positive,use one every year,20
negative,"After about 10 load of wash, it is already starting to rip. Cheap nylon.",20
positive,Almost $5 for 50 filters is really price gouging. Only reason I bought is because ordered my brother a new coffee maker and knew he would not have this size on hand. Not sure if would buy again unless price comes down drastically. I would rater invest in the gold permanent filter then waste money on the paper ones.,20
positive,"great concept, but perhaps it could be a tad bit sturdier. the plastic base really flexes a lot when getting a bigger load going. also, a way to drain it through the top might be helpful too as it is way faster than using the spout.",20
positive,Worked perfectly in my fridge and 2 filters at this price point are much better than the name brand which runs over 50.00 for a single filter.,20

negative,1.  They do not mention that you will need to install a clip to trick your machine into accepting this cup without error.<br />2.  I have been using the Keurig supplied reusable cup that came with the machine for a couple weeks and it works great. No grounds in my coffee. Fits perfectly. I wanted to have additional cups and purchased these. There are lots of grounds in my coffee every time. I spend extra time trying to wrangle the machine‚Äôs lid down due to poor fit. The cups lid doesn‚Äôt snap down securely. Just poor fit for the Keurig.<br /><br />Like I said... disappointed,20
positive,"Fit my Kenmore Elite, just snaps on the wire cage.",20
positive,"Delivered on time, easy to install and working well.",20
positive,Very inexpensive part to correct a very annoying problem.<br />Follow the instructions exactly because I believe the cleaning and application of silicone caulking (I used aquarium safe) is at least half of the fix here.<br />But it doesn‚Äôt hurt to have a gentle heat to keep the area above freezing temperature.,20
positive,Worked perfectly for a replacement to the broken door catch on our front load washer. Actually arrived a day earlier than originally scheduled! It's also nice that it has 2 in the package giving us a backup just in case. I definitely would buy this part again from this source.,20

Yeah me.",20
positive,"To make it easier, I let it try for 2 or 3 days, then I just pack the bottom of it with the lid clothed til it all comes out, which doesn't take much. So far, pretty much 99% or more comes right out. For the rest, I recommend the tiny bit that remains, use one of those baby bottle brushes to clean it with. Also scrub your finger in it in case u miss any.",20

Even before the first one wore out, I started looking for replacements, and came across these. A lot of what's on offer out here looks better-made than the General's, but isn't: these are metal, with a plastic underside that's a lot tougher than the stock knobs: I've removed and replaced these good dozen times and see no sign of them loosening yet, and they seem to recover from discoloration with the right amount of elbow-grease applied.

positive,A couple of years ago we bought a new Samsung refrigerator with built in ice maker at Best Buy.  A year later the ice maker quit working.  It freezes up.  We would defrost it and it would work for another week or two and then freeze up again.  Finally we gave up and bought one of these ice makers.  It works pretty well.  It produces a new batch of ice every 20 minutes or so.  Note that it runs 24/7.  The ice it makes melts and it makes new cubes out of the water that drips down into the basin.,20

For the price we paid (I think about $1200) this machine should have lasted many, many more years.

Dryer fires, apparently, are a thing. Lint after all is a very effective tinder and dryers produce heat... Considering all the other neglected maintenance we found in this 30 year old house I cleaned out the duct and found that the tin vent cover dented and the old flapper valve blocking much of the air-flow.<br /><br />Removing the old cover was a pain. After I chipped it out of the stucco there was no material to screw the base plate of the new vent cover. Instead I used expanding foam to fill the hole I‚Äôd hacked around the exit of the duct, cut it flush after it dried and then used clear caulk to glue the vent base to the wall. It‚Äôs important that the upper part of the unit remain removeable for future duct cleaning so I did not glue that to the wall but drilled into the stucco, coated a couple of screws with caulk and set them into the wall so the cover could slide on and off. It will make sense when you read the instructions.<br /><br />The cat‚Äôs pajamas.",20

positive,"I replaced the kitchen vent on my Imagine 17MKE with this prior to using the trailer the first time.  Install was straightforward.  I was shocked at the ‚Äúcould care less‚Äù quality of the original vent installation.  Is it really that hard to put screws in the flange holes and drive them in straight?  The fan on this is the size of the opening instead of a 5‚Äù fan in a 10‚Äù opening, and it can stay open in the rain.  Much better than retrofitting a rain proof hood over the original POS vent.",20

positive,This looks amazing - looks like it is very expensive - and it works great - pulls that cooking smell away fast!  Everything arrived quickly and everything was in perfect condition.,20
positive,"Makes perfect ice. One thing I love that I‚Äôm yet to see in another ice maker is the ice hardly ever sticks together. Typically you have to take the scoop and break up a clump of ice as it melts but not with this unit. Not sure what sort of sorcery they use to keep ice the perfect temperature at all times but they do it!!!<br /><br />Unit is VERY loud and that is the one flaw. I keep it downstairs in a room where this is not a huge deal. if you are looking for a unit to keep in the kitchen for example is the ONE scenario where I would pass on this unit. It seems like a weird design flaw as the motor really isn‚Äôt that loud, but rather the vibration the motor has on the metal casing that makes it loud.<br /><br />Also please remember to use a descaling often depending on the type of water you have. Almost every unit will deteriorate within a few months if you let the calcium build",20

Some kinda indication and also for the price the bulbs needed to come with it as well. The switch for the lights do have a bright and dim so that was nice, but should have came with bulbs. Would look alot nicer if the would have it in blk stainless too.",20

positive,"My mom got a hip replacement - and as she recovers, all she wants is crunchy ice with her drinks!<br /><br />We discovered unexpectedly that the ice is actually incredible for her surgery site too - it makes a wonderful ice pack!<br /><br />We love that it made ice in as little as 1 hour. Truly amazing.",20
positive,Exact match for my GE 164D3871 P001 oven. Installed in just a couple minutes. An easy job for any DIYer. I have had it in for a couple weeks with no problems.,20

positive,As described very good quality,20
positive,"They appear to be earth friendly, I compost them with the grounds. ez peezy.  I use one of the stainless steel baskets to put them in and voila.  Great price and great product, I use a lot of local beans to really make it a fun experience.",20
positive,The board set resolved the issue with the  ice maker not sensing the ice tray was empty.  The detector photo transistor/diode  on the receiver board has a shield or sleeve over the detector  that blocks light from the red LED from false triggering the sensor.  The new board set has a longer sleeve then the original.  The longer sleeve would not allow the on/off switch to move to the off position.  Swapped sleeves from the original board and switch now slides correctly.,20
positive,"Looks beautiful, almost retro, quicker than my last ice maker.  Overall VERY pleased, just wish small cube setting made cubes smaller.  They seem on the larger side to me, maybe medium?",20
positive,"Needed a drain hose that had a 90 degree bend on it to replace my ASKO D3251 drain hose that blew a hole in the side of it. It fit and was long enough to attach to my garbage disposal unit with a high loop, though it was close, definitely measure beforehand, and give yourself extra room to work with so you don't have to fully push your dishwasher in to hook it up. While I had extra hose clamps around the house already, it would have been nice to have 2 clamps in the package for those who don't.",20
positive,"It‚Äôs a smaller oven, but if you are tight on space this is a good one to have. Nice functions, simple, heats well. Love gas appliances since they work so much better.",20
negative,The coffee was see through. No taste whatsoever and I used dark french roast.  Waste of money.,20
positive,Clothes dry much faster with this filter! For sure to save money on our electric bill!,20
positive,Can't beat it for the price. The filter fit perfectly and works as well as the more expensive brands.,20
positive,Not much to say here - the filters are as described and arrived as scheduled.,20
positive,I've been using this sensor for somewhere around a year and it's still reporting 100% battery. Now whether or not that is accurate is up for debate but what I'm more interested in is the fact that it does in fact still have batter left. I've used a number of zwave devices that haven't performed near as well so this is a breath of fresh air. Also important is whether or not it signals when the door opens and it hasn't ever missed one that I know of based on my automations being triggered. I like that they just throw in temperature and humidity so you don't need a separate sensor for those. I don't know that it's really cut down on the number I have installed but I like that it gives me another datapoint. These sensors seem to be working fine too because I just looked at the display for my weather station and the inside numbers are right on with what this sensor is reporting. Physically the unit doesn't feel fancy. It's just average plastic that would crack if hit at all. Good news is on a door that shouldn't ever happen. You get a dim red light when it opens and a dim green one when closed. It's an unassuming design that I think could be smaller without too much work. On my white door frames you forget its there anyway though. This is a good sensor that signals when it should and you can just install and forget about it.,20
negative,Doesn't work on my refrigerator even though it said it did,20
positive,"Works great - super fast making the ice,  we use it at our seasonal campsite  -- need ice all the time and this fits the bill",20

positive,"Perfect fit, no problem installing.",20
positive,"Excelente congelador, cumpli√≥ mis espectativas, lleg√≥ rapidamente",20
negative,"I purchased this item in September 2020.  The first one I installed went great and connected perfectly.  The second and third ones will not connect to the refrigerator. No matter how hard I press in and twist, they will not seat in the receptacle.  I put the old one  (the first one) back in with absolutely no problem.  I can not find a way to contact the seller and the return window is well closed.  DO NOT PURCHASE!!!",20
positive,"Keeps the cold air outside when the drier is off.  Only problem with them is durability. The sun turns them brittle. Expect to replace it after about 5 years.  Otherwise, a good design.",20
positive,"I had been struggling with finding a part for my refrigerator that would work well enough to keep it from leaking in the front. This was the exact part and it was so valuable for the price i paid. Other sites were charging 3-4x as much for the ""OEM"" part, but this one worked well enough.",20
positive,This is the second time I have ordered these Samsung Aqua-Pure water filters.  I ordered the 2 pack since the price was better.  I've had no trouble using these. Working well. I wish there was a way to recycle the filters? I would recommend these for a replacement,20
positive,"Motor is Chinese, but runs EXTREMELY quietly.  We didn't even know our dryer could run without making noise before this.  There are no included wiring instructions, so be sure to take a picture of yours before you uninstall it, or draw a wiring diagram.  The Chinese motor has wiring ports which are slightly different than the original, and they ARE numbered 1 through 6 on the unit, so that gives you a general idea where they go, but there was some guesswork involved.  I got lucky and it worked the first time I tried it.  My only concern is longevity of the Chinese motor, but at this price I could buy another and still be okay.  I would recommend this to anyone who is able to take a picture, use a screwdriver and pliers and connect some wires.",20
positive,Fit and work on our 8 years old GE range hood.,20
positive,"Replaced an old light cover in old vent cover, this was a perfect fit!",20
positive,"Nothing, it was as advertised",20
positive,As described it was a perfect fit.,20
positive,Works great and the water flow is faster than the original one at a fraction of the cost.,20
positive,Product is easy to install. Sometimes I feel like I cannot keep it clean enough. I went to go wash it and found that it had left residue on my stove that I have to scrape off. Do not know if its from the heat of what.,20
negative,broke very easy,20
negative,"I strongly recommend against purchasing anything with the Panda (aka Midea) label. This machine malfunctioned in 4 months due to not having the correct machine shocks in stock for this model. Imagine a technician coming to your house on 5 different occasions and not having the correct or right amount of parts. Im sure you can imagine the frustration.<br /><br />After 5 visits from a 3rd party specialist via Sears, they came to conclusion that I could receive a refund. The refund will take 6-8 weeks! The processing is in New Jersey and I live NYC!<br /><br />Please purchase a machine from a more reliable company. I believe Haier would be a better choice.",20
positive,"Form, Function and Fit were the same as the original part.  Easy to install and solved the problem. My electric dryer is back in shape.",20
negative,Its ok,20
positive,"These filters are quite good, especially for the reasonable price. Some coffee grinds still get through to the brewed coffee, but I think I need to buy a coarser grind to solve this small problem.  I also tried wetting the filter after putting it in place, and putting an additional filter on top of the grinds before brewing.<br />Even using 2 filters per brew, these are still a great value.",20
positive,"It is a great product, and today I discovered it could be controlled remotely as I was playing with remote control Halloween lights. So the question is, why hasn‚Äôt a remote control been included?",20
positive,I bought this for an upcoming trip and I love that it won't take up much space in my bag. Hot water is easy to get from room service so this will be a handy way to make my own coffee. It does use more grounds per cup than other methods but the result is a very smooth cup of coffee.,20
positive,Works great for our refrigerator!,20
negative,Loved it but it died after a month. Fortunately I had purchased a warranty. It appears that most of the ice makers listed on Amazon have significant numbers of failures. Warranty highly recommended.,20
negative,did not fit my stove<br />missing fit information in description.,20
negative,These are OLD filters from GE and leak.  DO NOT BUY,20
negative,"Installed easily, water tasted fine, only complaint is it only lasted 4 months and I live in a city with water so God‚Äôs Nestle wants to bottle it to sell.",20

positive,It was working great,20
positive,"Instructions are not clear but will work for you, read them 3 or 4 times then they will be clear....Once we understood how to hang the vent it was easy.  Fan is quiet and has great suction, lights are good and in the right place so you can see the total cooking surface.  It also looks great above our stove.. Nice bonus a free pair of heat resistant gloves, after you review product....",20
positive,I just loved the product easy to install,20
positive,"Fit my GE perfectly.  Water comes out perfectly. Bought the two pack. Best price each. Excellent, not just for price.  No more spending $45 for the GE one.  Fast shipping too.",20
positive,"Front load washer wouldn‚Äôt go into high speed spin due to door not locking, this fixed the problem rather than buying the whole $75 assembly",20
positive,This is so much better than in the picture!  The color is vibrant.  Loving it! :),20
negative,"Out of the three k-cup filters, none of the covers wouldn't fit on one of the filters. So basically, I only received two functional k-cup filters. Those filters that DID work, worked great! I put in my ground coffee, close the lid, and voila! Coffee is ready within minutes. Saves a lot of money in the long run as the k-cups you buy outside are VERY expensive compared to this method.<br /><br />I'd recommend this product, but can't guarantee that all 3 filters are functional. Mine weren't. Hope this helps!<br /><br />(Gave 2 stars as one filter doesn't work. Otherwise, definitely a 4-star product!)",20
negative,I'm trying another set.  The first set bigger cover started to rust already.,20
positive,It‚Äôs a perfect fit and works well.  This model of freezer ice maker is not as good as others.  But if anyone has the need this is a great replacement grinder bin.,20
negative,"I installed this part and everything worked well for 7 months then the spring broke. Not worth the money, should have looked for a higher quality part.",20
positive,"Like the combo of the frothing pitcher and the drawing tool. The metal is nice, seems to be good quality. I think so long as they‚Äôre taken care of they should last a long time.",20
negative,I was satisfied with this product until it started turning off and on all the time.I only been using this for 5 days and it's already doing that.I can only use on low setting..Its also starting to melt this could be a fire hazard.Getting rid of it.Dont waste your money on this.Spend the extra money to buy a safe dryer.,20
positive,This filter looks and fits identically to a Samsung brand filter. The price difference is awesome and you can't tell a difference in taste.,20
positive,Easy to install,20
negative,U it cools great And looks great but very loud fan and even louder when compressor kicks on,20
positive,Perfect fit!  Easy to install and did the trick to repair my freezer.,20
positive,Perfect fit. Bought the tools 383EER4001A and 383EER4004A to do the job. You probably can do it without but it made the repair much easier. The challenge is to remove and reattach the clamps that hold the seal in place.,20
positive,"I just got this, so I cannot comment on how well it does its job. However, I was not able to set up the day, month, date feature, which bothers me, and somehow I am unable to go back to 12h set up. It looks good, so I'll keep it. Hopefully the time/temp/humidity features works well.",20
positive,"Great !!,<br />This is a must have, if you love Areopress coffee.",20
positive,"This is a great stainless steel pitcher. I needed a backup for my Breville machine and this is just as nice, if not nicer than the original one that came with it. Works great, love the wide pour spout, and it's nice and easy to clean. Will use this as my primary and the original as my backup!",20
positive,My wife is always complaining about our stove having a space on either side of it between it and the counters. This product has solved that problem for us by providing a bridge between the stove and the countertops. It works very well and stays in place and the heat does not seem to affect it. I would recommend this as a way to fix a problem that could be very expensive to fix by either buying a new stove or new countertops,20
positive,"These keys worked great for replacing the lost one, I'm glad to have found this on Amazon!",20
positive,Was easy to install I replaced my old broken one.,20
negative,No way accurate.  I bought 2 and they were totally different temps showing.,20
positive,"Bought the washer and a set of casters so I can roll it around. So far, works as expected. No complaints.",20
positive,I love using my favorite coffee again. Only bad thing is it‚Äôs too hot to open to empty and make a cup for someone else.  It‚Äôs expensive at $15 each to buy extra ones.,20
positive,Bosch dishwasher she863wf5n just got this to replace our 10 year old dishwasher. This one is installed different than the old one . The electric has a box you but under the sink. I would like to say do not install this by laying it down take time and screw it up on the wall . I think that is safety because of water . It is a quiet dishwasher. I do not like the plastic latch . The stainless steel is the same as our old model in the inside. On the outside a magnet will stick so there is no nickel in the stainless steel front . Nickel in stainless will not rush and it is acid resistant. This dishwasher on the front is Brushed that gives it a nicer look . So I hope that this works as long as the old one . It should clean up nice with the brushed steel . Only time will tell if this will last so far so good .,20
positive,My water has never tasted so filtered. It is like drinking from a crystal goblet of sunlight melted glacier water.,20
positive,"Fits our 12 year old dishwasher.  Doesn't have the 'trim' the original had, but that makes it lighter, and really, it holds our table ware just as well.",20
negative,Had purchased an open box product that was well discounted.  Item arrived missing a motor connection that was broken off the housing causing the unit to be not functional.  Is should have worked just fine if it weren‚Äôt damaged.  Damage not caused in shipping since broken off pieces were not in box.  Should have been properly inspected before it was shipped.  Open box is one thing.  Broken in an open box is another.,20
positive,"Need to replace a defective dryer element and bought this kit.  It came very fast and was as expected. The only complaint, which is minor is the instruction to covert the heat thermost wiring to fit was a bit confusing.",20
positive,Great,20
positive,Exactly as described,20
positive,Worked with my Whirpool GGW9250PW0 and GHW9100LW1.,20
positive,Shipped fast. Install was easy. Came with extra filters. It looks nice!,20
positive,I purchase these by the case.  Work great in my one cup brewer at work.  Always have a hot cup of coffee whenever I want one.,20
positive,They fit my coffee pot nice,20
negative,Waste of money! Not only did it not reduce the vibration of the washing machine it actually made it worse. I believe the issue is with the consistency of the rubber being too soft. As the machine vibrates the rubber pads act as a trampoline increasing the  overall motion of the machine. I took them back off of the machine after only 2 cycles. Guess I will have to find some other use for them.,20
positive,"Easy to install, Value for money",20
negative,"don't care for the material for this use at all, they are not the same in size at all and the color differs",20
positive,"This small, enclosed dishwasher box is the bomb for small items you need to put in the dishwasher. I also love the clips that easily fit over the tines in the racks to hold light items in place. It works so very well. I couldn't be happier.",20
positive,easy install...works as described,20
positive,Very easy to use,20
positive,the part fits and works.  the original began to fail as the bearings and rear spider support for the tub drum failed entirely.,20
positive,Thin filter but gets the job done,20
positive,"It fit nice, it tastes good, what else is there to say?",20
positive,Unfortunately this did not work. Which is why I gave it 4 stars. The customer service was fantastic on returning this item.,20
positive,los quemadores son algo cortos no ensamblan bien en el plato me costo acomodarlos pero por el precio no es un mal producto ya instalados funcionan muy bien,20
negative,Junk,20
negative,When I got the package it was covered in some sort of liquid. The magnet front and back had already began to peel off. I would not order this again and I‚Äôm disappointed I spent $6 on something I couldn‚Äôt even use once.,20
positive,"Dryer: 11060992990 kenmore electric dryer from 2001.  Symptom: push button *starts* the dryer spinning, let it go and it just stops; holding it down kept it running but the heat would never go on.  Checked the thermostats and fuses and the heater, the timer was fine... then noticed some brown scorching on the circuit board... popped it out, popped this one in and it worked!",20
negative,"We love the cooling, the LED lighting, most things about the frig. However, we are buying a new frig after just 3 yrs because the fan has started making very loud noises and humming. They haven't been able to fix it. Seems to be a design flaw. Spent $600 so far and still the very loud humming and noises like the fan is scraping something, Would not buy this refrigerator again.",20
positive,"Works well, as agreed.",20
positive,"Great product, easy to follow instructions and works just peachy.",20
positive,"Not only can you use this for the dryer. But, it works great for under the couch and in the between the truck seats. Wish I would of found this sooner. Over all good product",20
positive,No evidence-based complaints so far but was disappointed when I pulled out the Samsung filter to see one o-ring seal on end and two further back but this product only had one and one. There's a reason Samsung puts one and two. For an extra couple dollars couldn't this vendor also have put one and two??,20
positive,can use dryer.  hope it lasts.,20
positive,"I was a little apprehensive when I saw all the pieces. But the instructions point you to a youtube video, and after watching it this was no problem to install, pretty quick. Now the upper rack isn't flopping all over the place. Very happy.",20
positive,Works so much better than the after market or fake brands. Insanely expensive.,20
positive,"parts for this old ice maker is hard to find, thanks for having it. fits perfectly",20
positive,Save some money being able to use your own coffee. Works well in Kerig machine just make sure that you grind your coffee pretty fine also like Expresso.,20
positive,This was exactly what I needed and worked perfectly!,20
positive,"product works great, have used same filters for years",20
positive,Purchased this part for a Wolf range model #R486G.  Great fit.  The ignitor comes with plenty of wire length.  I actually had to trim some off so there wouldn't be so much slack that may find its way near the burner.  Only complaint is the cheap wire nuts that come with it kept on spinning and didn't lock down on the wire splice.  But that is a minor complaint.  I used some spare wire nuts I had laying around from other jobs.  Will definitely buy again once the larger companion oven ignitor goes but hopefully that won't happen for a while since we mainly use the smaller oven.,20
positive,Excellent,20
positive,Works great at a fraction of the whirlpool price,20
positive,They worked perfectly!! Love them!,20
positive,"I received this product on time, and installing it was a breeze.  I ran 2 gallons through it, and the water is clear.  Since I only use water in coffee, etc., I can't say anything about the taste, except my coffee tasted the same or better.  I would recommend this water filter for purchase.  Making it even better, is it cost half what the dealer charged.",20
positive,I bought this item to dry my sneakers. It works great.,20
positive,"Works good in my fridge.  This is the second one I have ordered.  I feel like the price is kind of high for what it is, but you got to have it.",20
positive,Perfect fit. Easy install and works better than the original.,20
negative,"I have chickens that lay large eggs and I was hoping this would work, but the lid wont close with my large eggs.  It would work for small, store type eggs maybe.  It is sturdy enough to hold eggs so I was disappointed at the depth of the container.  I think I can use it for christmas storage maybe",20
positive,"Great product. GE wanted $89.00, great deal on Amazon.",20
positive,What I exspected and was easy to install,20
positive,Just as good as name brand,20
positive,Everything I needed it to be.  It is large enough to be practical but small enough to not be obtrusive.  I would recommend this for anyone who needs just a little bit more freezer space.,20
positive,Perfect replacement filter for my GE Microwave.  The filters are very high quality.,20
positive,Excellent product performing as advertised. Great price and worth your consideration as an OEM replacement.,20

positive,"I have the Samsung Family Hub and these filters were really expensive to order through the app, this was a great price and so far so good.",20
positive,"Good dryer vent, but it does not open all the way when dryer on. Kind of scared the dryer going to burn with all the lent in the pipe!",20
positive,Great price!,20
positive,Fit perfectly in my Samsung Washer.  Easy to replace valve.  Took about 30 minutes total time.  Make sure you open the top cover of your washer and verify the part number you need before ordering.,20
positive,No room in my fridge for ice so I bought this and it is on my counter,20
positive,Immediately improved the water pressure in my fridge water! Filtering out the sediment that was slowing things down.,20
positive,These replaced another set that were just old & not cleanable anymore. They were a perfect fit/match & look much nicer than my old ones.,20

positive,Got filter very quick and gives excellent water taste,20
positive,"Not sure what the thickness rating is supposed to be but the product was sturdy and installed very easily.  Strong enough exhaust for my hot showers. Noise level is moderate, about what I expected and given the exhaust performance it‚Äôs totally acceptable.",20
positive,It seems to be just as good as the recommended brand and is a fraction of the cost. Did not have any problems changing it out.,20
positive,It works. That's all I need from coffee filters.,20
positive,I found out about these during quarantine and hate doing dishes. My place i live in is pretty small and this thing does wonders. Got it on sale and didnt know if it would be easy to use. It is and is amazing.,20
negative,"I bought the hood three months ago. When it first arrived, i tested it, it works fine. Now after three months, we finally got time to install it and when we turn it on.

positive,Was getting the same message on these type of larger orange replacement cups.  Bought another reusable and it was all black with a white dot at the 9 o‚Äôclock position on the lid.  Worked fine on my 2.0 Keurig so I made a removable white tape circle and viola both replacement cups worked like a charm. Not sure why mine didn't initially work and bought another orange one at walmart and it too did not work.  Love the ability to make either a pot or larger cup of coffee than 10 oz.,20
positive,Received the items in a reasonable amount of time. It included everything listed and the parts are durable and reliable.,20
negative,Connections are not secure without a bunch of tape. The Velcro clamps do not work. Great product in theory. But still needs work to be user friendly.,20
positive,Im verry happy üòÉ Thanks!!,20

positive,"I only used it once, but it is easy to use and takes the wrinkle out right away. No need to keep on go through the material over and over again.  The size and portability seems to be appropriate for long trips.",20

positive,"My husband works out of town and lives in our camper and the little fridge has no ice maker.  I got this for him to sit on the counter and not need a hose for water.  It small, light weight and easy to use.  Plug it in, turn it on add water and with an minutes you have your first dump of ice.  When the ice basket is full it stops making ice.  The ice is good and solid so stays frozen for a long time. We are saving so much money now instead of him having to buy bags of ice.  This was money well spent.",20
positive,We had a similar ice machine that stopped working.  Ordered this one and am so happy.  Makes batches of ice very quickly.,20
positive,"This range is amazing.  It is leaps and bounds above its predecessor.  The Wi-Fi is kind of useless unless you remember to hit the button all the time but it heats well, and the Power Burner that can actually reduce all the way to a true simmer burner is perfect for soups and other large cooking items that I used to have to change burners all the time.  The oven lights are ridiculously bright and the easy roll tray in the top oven really helps so you don't accidently touch the sides.  Is it worth the price tag, maybe not but it is probably the best performing stove I have ever owned.<br /><br />After reading another review on here I think it is worth clarifying.  Originally we purchased the all gas version of this oven and had nothing but issues with the pre-heat.  The oven would continuously turn off.  GE replaced the oven twice and serviced it three times before allowing us to swap to the dual-fuel version.  Since the switch no issues and we are almost a year in.",20
positive,Good quality.,20
positive,Works great for a #2 filter! The only issue is I can‚Äôt use it on certain cups because the ring on the bottom (that keeps it from slipping and sliding off your coffee cup) is an oval rather than a circle like my other pour overs. So if you have a more narrow opening for your coffee cups it won‚Äôt sit right.,20
negative,"I purchased this freezer less than a year ago, and it has begun randomly tripping the dedicated circuit breaker, meaning that, without warning, our frozen food is left to spoil. So far, we've lost about $100 worth of meat. After doing some research, I found that this problem has to do with the circuitry of the unit. I called Curtis (the manufacturer behind these RCA and Igloo freezers) and jumped through a few hoops with pictures, serial numbers, etc. over email. Then about six weeks later, I received an email stating that in order to proceed with the warranty, I would need to cut off the power cord and take a hammer to the front and back of the unit; then, take pictures of the destroyed unit, peel off the stickers with serial numbers, etc, and mail them in. After all this, Curtis would decide if my claim was worthy of a repair(!) or a replacement. There was no timeframe given for receiving a resolution. And in the meantime, I'm without a freezer, defective or otherwise. Oh--and I have to pay the disposal fee for the destroyed machine.<br /><br />I feel like I'm on trial for purchasing a defective freezer from Curtis. Here's an idea: Don't make garbage in the first place.<br /><br />Amazon, please begin making your own appliances. Put these con-artists out of business. I know your customer service will be better than this--and I will gladly be one of your first patrons.",20

positive,You can use your favorite brand of coffee and make it as strong or as weak as you like.,20
positive,"Excellent filters. They definitely do a  great job at keeping extra oil out of the coffe and they don't get soggy when used like a paper filter, overall very happy",20
negative,"While these definitely cut down on the grounds you get in your cup from using the filter basket without, they are still pretty messy and allow some grounds through.  Recommend the filters with the top flap as a better choice.",20
negative,"[[VIDEOID:f842f5c6195cbf433079d37c1d74f848]] I really wanted for this product to work but there are a few design flaws. I used it a total of 2 times and the bottom connecting piece to the motor came off. Tried to screw it back in, fell off again after a few minutes. The top lid to contain the water does not latch on, this machine is held together in place by the miracle of gravity.<br /><br />This product comes in two pieces so the point of connection is weak, it doesn't even latch to stay in place. For the brief moment it worked it was decent and the spin option was as well. You can only fill the bucket no more than two third or the water will spill because the rubber part is to soft and bends letting lots of  water out and flooding your floor (happened twice -_-). The motor smelled overheated after one use.",20
positive,Wheels look to be identical quality as the originals.  Easy replacement.  Back to dishwashing!,20
positive,I have this old fridge and all the bins broke but I‚Äôm not ready to purchase a new fridge so I went to the Sears website and found my model and searched  it. I found the parts number I needed and made sure it matched the compatible number it advertised. It fit with no problem! I‚Äôll update how long it lasts later but so far so good!,20
positive,"The price speaks for itself especially when you consider the two most popular home improvement stores sell the same oven for $100.00 more. My only real disappointment was although it came quickly the first one came with a shattered door like several others experienced. Amazon very quickly replaced it, it came a day sooner than promised. The packaging inside was a complete redesign from the first one and the oven was in perfect condition. It took about 5 minutes to attach the supplied pigtail to the unit and another 5 minutes to make the connections to the house wiring and slide it in the opening in the wall. There are two very convenient handles incorporated into the sides of the oven to facilitate this part of the installation. Since I am replacing a twenty year old oven and I‚Äôm well into my seventy‚Äôs the push button controls are a bit of a mystery but so far it‚Äôs been interesting exploring them. I do wish a book had been included but Amazon does provide a link to one. The online instructions details a burn-in procedure to remove manufacturing oils , be sure to provide ventilation. The oven was installed less than one hour and we received six compliments, mostly younger people. It‚Äôs very attractive and even cooks well. It will work out perfect for my wife and myself.",20
positive,"The smaller filter for the Cuisinart &#34;keurig&#34; type coffee maker, I could not find these filters in any store!",20
negative,"The flow rate of these filters when installed on my Samsung refrigerator is EXTREMELY LOW. Without a filter, an average size cup fills up in 10 seconds. With one of these installed, it takes 1 minute or so.  The output is barely a trickle. The water does taste clean, but it is such an inconvenience to fill a glass, I've resorted to using the faucet instead.",20
positive,Cubes melt too quickly while waiting  for the basket to fill,20
positive,Perfect replacement for my old Frigidaire ice maker that stopped making ice.,20
negative,They are nice and east to clean they fit well the problem I have with them is the magnets that hold them came unglued from the caps themselves,20
negative,This item says universal but it was to large fir my kuerig.universal means all correct.,20
positive,to filter my drinking water,20
negative,Broke after 2 months of use. Such a waste of money,20
positive,This was the second time I ordered this part. It dropped right into place and got the heat to work on my dryer again. Will order again if the dryer needs another one. Make sure to check the continuity of the old parts with a multimeter to be sure what needs a replacement. There will be no continuity (no beep sound) across a bad fuse.,20
positive,OEM replacement at nearly half the price of a big box store. Fit right in.,20
positive,"I'm a single guy, live alone which means the ice machine had minimum use.  Water indication light stopped working after 4 mos, no biggie at first, but now it doesn't work at all.  The Fault Alarm light just displays.  Sent email to manufacture as there is no 800# to call.  Still waiting on response.  Unit comes with 12 month warranty.",20
positive,"Very easy, for my husband to replace. He did need to use his own tool as this kit didn't  include one.",20
positive,Great deal 3 filters for the price of 1!,20
negative,"Nice filters for the frig, but this new filter model costs twice as much as the discontinued one, and it does not filter anything more than the old one; plus the directions indicate that it has a shorter life span. Took off one star for Whirlpool doubling the price, and another star for designing the filter to last nearly half as long. I'll probably still use the filter until the frig's end-of-life indicator goes off, instead of the taking Whirlpool's recommendation. I still wouldn't want to go with a generic filter model, unless I find one that appears to be equal quality of the OEM.",20
positive,"Perfect size , low noise at spinning time , many cycles , easy install , I love it .",20
positive,"We use this ice cub maker all the time.  You need to find a good place to keep it to be able to use all the time.  It's not small, but small enough to find that perfect spot close to an outlet.  Easy to fill with water to make the ice cubes.  Makes them fast, in about 10-15 minutes for each batch.  The basket fills in about 45 minutes.",20
positive,This product has been great. It was almost plug and play replacement for our old system.  This is attached to our fridge. Love our ice cubes. Best tasting ever. Ours came with extra filters. This was about an hour install for my husband. Worked great.,20
positive,"I had my doubts, but it fits perfectly.",20
positive,"the idea of putting these heat-resistant sleeves on the front of oven racks seemed great - they'd let me pull out hot oven racks without burning my fingers or hand - but I've been disappointed by this sort of thing before.  I expected them to be flimsy, or not really stand up to heat.  But when I put them on, they worked exactly as promised.  I can open the oven, pull a rack out to put something on or take something off without putting on a clunky oven mitt or grabbing a dish towel.  That seems like a small thing, but it changes the way you use the oven.  Putting them on the racks took a bit of dexterity, but once on, they've been doing their job flawlessly for several months - exactly as I'd hoped and much better than I'd expected.",20
positive,The price is right just what I need,20
negative,Never wouldmbuy agaiin. Junk that I hey wont return,20

positive,"Here is my review after owning and using daily since Feb of 2019. Its now April 2021.<br />Great Machine. I've had NO problems mechanically out of the machine.<br />I've removed 1 star, this is because of the cleaning.<br />I've always used distilled water. I've always used the Opal brand cleaner.<br />It is IMPOSSIBLE to keep this machine clean without doing a deep disassemble every once in a while.<br />I followed the manufacturer guideline for cleaning and even used their chemicals for 2 years.<br />After 2 years I took it apart found it to be the most disgusting things I've ever seen. I can't believe I've been drinking what was inside.  My suggestion, use white vinegar as the official cleaner is overpriced now.<br />Clean it about every 2-3 weeks with white vinegar.<br /><br />If you have one and haven't taken it all the way apart, do it now. It will take you 2-3 hours to take apart, clean the tubes, clean the water tank inside (white tank with UV light), take out the metal cylinder in the center where the ice is made and pushed up through and clean in there. It will all be gross.  Maybe if you clean more frequently than recommended manufacturer guideline, it wont be, but if you find after cleaning a dark residue in the water holding area after a week or so, you need to take it apart.<br />Its not TOO bad to take apart.<br /><br />Overall makes the best ice, saves you $$, easy on the teeth. Even with the cleaning problems, I will continue to enjoy it.<br /><br />Below is my first review back in March of 2019.<br /><br /> I've had this a  month now. I wanted to give it a good try before writing a review.  Overall If you like nugget ice. Buy this you wont regret it. My cons, it is a little noisy, I keep it on my computer desk to have access to it and its louder than my PC.  The scoop, I tend to spill ice regularly when filling up a cup, but it could just be me, not the scoop. Overall these are minor things, and it is worth every penny. I've not used the cleaning kit yet, but will sometime soon. I'm sure all will be fine. The machine looks really nice, its heavy! The water seems to run out frequently and it is a little annoying filling up as when I pull out the ice tray some water gets on the table, but with the side tank which I've ordered comes in, I think it will be ALL GOOD and the perfect Ice machine. I think I need another one. One for home, one for the office.",20
positive,Was a little worried about spending so much on an internet buy. The washer/dryer came with no issues. The shipping was reasonable and came on time. Good product. Good buy.,20

positive,The filters are as described and delivered on time.,20
positive,"I did a major kitchen remodel and had to purchase all my appliances ASAP because the kitchen cabinet maker needed the specs. I purchased a Whirlpool vent hood in Sept 2020 at the start of constriction, and it looked similar to this Cosmo vent hood. I bought Whirlpool because I preferred name brand. Well, fast forward to last week when they were installing appliances: the glass from my Whirlpool hood shattered and I was outside the timeframe for refund/replacement. On the fly, I purchased the Cosmo vent hood since the specs on the duct cover were similar to that of the Whirlpool. Let me tell you, I should have just gone with Cosmo to begin with!!! It‚Äôs super sleek looking in my new kitchen, but for 1/5 the price! I could not be happier with this purchase. We cooked dinner and I was still able to have a decent conversation with hubby while the vent was on. I was worried I‚Äôd have to sacrifice noise due to the affordability, but man I was wrong. Love it!",20
positive,It was exactly what I was looking for.,20
positive,Excellent product and mobile.,20
positive,It is not as easy to apply as shown in some of the videos.  It took time to work out the air bubbles.  Once installed can't tell it from the real thing.,20
positive,"Only have had it so 1 day but so far it is so cool. My husband is having so much fun with it. It's only about  the size of  a big , tall toaster with a carrying  handle. ( See Pic) We have made a whole freezer tray of ice and an extra bag. You need to put the ice in the freezer after a bunch gather in the bin because the bin is not a freezer. They recommend not to use it in very hot weather. This machine truly drops a handful of 9 little closed end tubes every 9 minutes. (See photo next to regular tea spoon.)  I thought they would be two small and melt fast, but the actually made the drink colder because they have more surface area for liquid to flow into. We have bottled water in a dispenser right next to it  so it is very easy to  access. So far it's great because we purposely do not have a ice maker in our freezer because our tap water is not drinkable in my opinion and no filters would help.",20
positive,We have used before they work great.,20
positive,Easy to clean & perfect fit to my stove,20
positive,"Got it here on Amazon for less than half the price of local appliance stores, that didn't even have one in stock... and I called everywhere local. The description mentions several part numbers this motor is compatible with except the one I had, and I only know that from calling appliance stores when they cross referenced part numbers. The fan part number I had was WR60X10138 in case anyone reading this needs to know, and this new motor is actually an upgrade from that part. Don't know why it was upgraded?... as the one I had lasted for years before it quit. This one came with a yellow ground wire which mine didn't have, but it's not needed anyways, just install and ignore it, as the refrigerator should already have a separate ground wire from the mounting bracket. This is a good motor, same exact size and shape as the original and installation was easy on my fridge.",20

Opting to go to the laundry mat for the first several months was ok but after doing the math, this guy paid for itself in just 4 months of no longer having to go to the laundry mat and is way more convenient as I can stay home and complete other chores around the house while my machine gets to work.<br />The spin bin works incredibly well as most items are only slightly damp upon removal from the machine so it doesn‚Äôt take long to dry on the line or even hung up inside the house of weather doesn‚Äôt suit.<br /><br />I definitely love this machine and the time and money it‚Äôs saved us so far!",20

I didn't know that it doesn't keep the ice frozen in its storage basket (but how could it, because that's where you put the freshwater too), it's easy enough to remove to the freezer or we leave the ice in the basket all day and they are slighlty defrosted. It's great to have ice cubes in 7-9 minutes and its fun to watch the ice being made.  Unfortunately my model stopped making cubes in less that 9 minutes, now it takes 20-30 minutes per cycle.

However, the dispenser is now so slow that I am replacing the filter with A Samsung one.  For someone who uses it here and there for an 8 oz. glass it's probably no big deal but I like to fill my 1 liter bottles 4-5 times a day.  It takes several minutes to fill with this filter, and often shuts off in the middle.  (I think this must be a timed safety feature to keep from causing a flood).  Anyway, I wouldn't recommend this for someone who is a very heavy water-drinker like myself.",20

positive,It fit like a glove very easy to install. Our water and ice cubes have a excellent flavor.Even our coffee is much better as we use the water from dispenser instead of fauset.,20
positive,"It is difficult to judge whether the filter works as well as the GE GSWF.  The ice cubes taste the same.  It fits the space properly. How else can you tell?.<br /><br />One comment that I can judge:  It would be nice if it was clearer as to when it is fully installed.  The GE version ends up with the turn 'handle' (really just an extrusion at the bottom of the filter) fully horizontal, with the arrows pointing each way to install or remove the filter.  This version just kind of went in and the handle/extrusion ended up sort of sideways, kind of pointing at 11:00 and 5:00.  So it's hard to be sure that it's installed properly.  This would seem to be an easy improvement, but I guess the make of the product didn't realize that this feature is a plus.",20

positive,"I bought these to replace my old raggedy drip pans. I measured the old ones to make sure they‚Äôd fit, which they did perfectly. It‚Äôs been hard to find the right size for my old stove since I have 1 large burner and 3 smaller ones. These were very easy to install and make the stove look much nicer.",20
negative,I wish I had read the first review that showed the comparison of the openings between this filter and the original Samsung filter. It's pure mechanics. The hole in this filter is seriously smaller than the original filter so of course my water flow is going to be reduced.<br /><br />Too bad. Won't make that mistake again.,20
positive,Repeat order and it is the same as previously ordered.  Best quality.  Thank you.,20
negative,"Don‚Äôt fit my whirlpool,, and they made me pay return shipping!",20
positive,It is not long enough; way too short; the edges stick up.,20
positive,Our order was filled super fast and the part works perfectly.,20
positive,"I am a dryer vent specialist and if you have to have a indoor vent, this is the one to buy. Mounts nicely, easy to refill and the stainless screen is easy to clean with a couple of cranks of the handle.",20
negative,"I recently installed one just like this one on dryer & it got lopsided quick. So I order this one, so we‚Äôll see how long this one will last.",20
positive,seemed reasonably balanced.,20
positive,"Replacement fridge for our old side-by-side.  We love the french door style with roomy interior.  The drawers are NOT sloppy and get off track like the GE and Whirlpool models we looked at.  The glass shelves with the spill proof border makes cleanup easy(the paper milk carton sometimes leaks).<br /><br />The drawers in the fridge keep the items organized.  The pantry drawer with adjustable dividers keep cheeses separated and make that open and quick grab take only a second.<br /><br />The freezer at the bottom opens wide enough to access the bottom easily.  There is a drawer which can be pulled out all the way, so items in the back of that drawer can be seen.  I must say it is one of the best engineered freezers as far as accessibility.<br /><br />The water/ice dispenser is on the door.  Nice easy to read text/images on the computer screen above the water/ice.  Water taste fantastic even though we have terrific tap water because it goes through a replaceable Samsung filter which removes impurities.<br /><br />No problem with ice production.  Good volume of ice, crushed or cubed.  The computer readout above the ice/water dispenser is a nice blue text, telling what the features are enabled, what the temp is in the fridge or freezer, and has a little beep that tells when changing information.  There is a little audible alarm if the door was left open which is nice because there are more efficient ways to cool the house.<br /><br />Very pleased with this product.[[ASIN:B001P63PD2 Samsung RF267ABWP 25.5 cu. ft. French-Door Refrigerator with 5 Glass Shelves, Spill Proof, Twin Cooling System, CoolSelect Pantry, Power Freeze/Cool Options, External Ice/Water Dispenser and LED Display: White]]",20
positive,"Installed with no problem, worked for about a month and then it died, absolute garbage, do not buy",20
positive,"Pricey, but worth every penny!! I love having nugget ice on endless supply. The unit can be a little noisy, but usually when it needs more water or needs to be cleaned. Best purchase EVER!!!",20
negative,"Needed it to leave on trip.  Had to drill two holes and use part of the old one for spacers. But, it covers the vent hole on the camper and is still on after 3500+ miles of interstate driving.",20
negative,The part was what I needed bit there were missing peices.,20
positive,Work perfect. Exactly like the ones that came with the coffee maker.,20
positive,No issues.,20
positive,filter was perfect in every eway. So glad to find this on Amazion. Hard to find this size bit you had it.,20
positive,Did what it was supposed to do ‚ù§Ô∏è,20
positive,Perfect fit. Our 18 year old hotpoint gas range was not holding its temperature through the cooking cycle. I timed the ignition cycle and it took 90 seconds to light the gas tube. That is on the outer limit of the igniter. The new one lit in 40 seconds- problem solved.,20
positive,perfect fit!,20
negative,"My unit arrived with the box opened and the unit had some bending on the back. I decided to keep it since the bends would not be seen once installed. The unit fit perfectly and was easy to install, however the fan makes a loud hum when it is running. It makes much more noise than the original, It also has a number of places you can see where it was spot welded in the factory and it shows on the finished side. I would not purchase this item again.",20
positive,Fixed my dryer door at a reasonable price.  Works like factory.  Holding up well. Thank you.,20
positive,Works great and very quiet,20
negative,Only lasted a couple  of months.  Trash,20
negative,Product only last for 1 week. Would not recommend this product.,20
positive,Very easy to use and to clean. Does not have a lingering smell or flavor after cleaning.,20
positive,Great replacement piece for my dryer!,20
positive,We purchased this as a replacement for the original door and frame assembly for our ice maker.  This seemed to be better quality than the original and it could not have been easier to install.  Great product!!,20
positive,"We love this cabinet hood and at the price we got it at, it was a STEAL compared to the local hardware stores. It was easy to install and it worked so well for our house.",20
positive,Super cute and easier to keep handles clean.,20
positive,Very quite and there are three speeds and nice lights.,20
positive,Part fit as original,20
negative,"I was hopeful to use these with the Keurig Slim since I have wanted to reduce waste with the pods. Problems.<br />1. The only instructions inside was to show how to put the pod in the machine. Nothing about the amount to put in the pod. So I filled it a bit more than halfway as a guess.<br />2. Coffee grounds weren‚Äôt filtered out and was in the cup.<br />3. When I opened the machine to take the reusable pod out, it had overflowed inside the mechanism which was a pain to clean out. Luckily no damage to the machine.",20
positive,"These have done a great job at reducing the amount of cleaning and maintenance I've had to do on my Honeywell QuietCare Humidifier HCM-6009. It is on the medium setting, so its on about half the time and experiences a lot of standing water but hasn't resulted in rapid bacteria growth in the humidifier.<br />It doesn't eliminate the need for occasional cleaning, though. Got to keep the humidifier maintained well, with cool wick devices.",20
positive,The thermostats in our new apartment did not have a visible temperature reading. These fit the purpose nicely and were not expensive. Arrived quickly.,20
positive,"Was as described and fits nicely under small freezer, washing machine, ect",20
positive,My washing machine wouldn't drain so we looked on YouTube and found this part could need replacement. We changed it and it works!!!,20
negative,"Was good while it lasted, however just a few weeks ago the machine stopped working.  Several months ago the indicator light letting you know to fill it with water stopped working so we'd go to the machine and there would be no ice because there was no water in it, but no one refilled it because the indicator light wasn't working and the ""full"" light stayed on even when there was no ice.  Now it doesn't do anything. No ice. No noise. I guess the cost was more of a ""rental cost for a year"" than a purchase.",20
positive,Element is a 100% perfect fit for my oven. Easy to change works like new.,20
positive,Replaced the original just like I needed.,20
positive,These fit perfectly and were very easy to install. I‚Äôve only installed them couple weeks ago so can‚Äôt comment on how long they last but so far they‚Äôre working very well. Im happy now after being frustrated with originals wearing off in few years. After buying these the support team also sent an email with links to YouTube videos to install them. That was very helpful.,20
positive,Refrigerator water filter.,20
positive,Runs our Samsung 27 cu ft refrigerator perfectly. No issues so far and never runs low power according to the units lights. Happy with it.,20
positive,Less expensive easy to install,20
positive,"While the belt was not an exact replacement for the OEM one, it is close enough to fit with the proper tension and does the job adequately.  All other parts appear to be direct replacements and installed with no issues.",20
positive,As described,20
positive,Great value for money.  Easy install,20
positive,Good value for item that is discontinued in store.,20
positive,great price,20
negative,Horrible product worked for one load of laundry then blew thermal fuse do not buy!!!,20
positive,"Easy to use.  Just open the fridge, flip down the cover on the old filter, pull it out and put this in.  Push the cover back up and the new filter is in!  You will need to let it run to clear any carbon dust that may have accumulated in it from the vibration of shipping (which happens no matter which filter or brand you buy).  I ran 2 gallons through mine even though it was visibly clear long before that.",20
negative,I order the 3 piece kit and only got the flue tunnel. Buyers beware.,20
negative,I‚Äôm changing my review from a five star to a one. Worked great for several months and then completely stopping working! I realize nothing last anymore but this is ridiculous! So glad I didn‚Äôt buy a second one like I stated in my first review,20
positive,"I think I ordered the wrong knobs as these are slightly different from the oem  knobs. They fit, look great and are more rugged than the originals. I am very pleased with this item.",20
positive,"Makes it 30 times easier to clean your stove top. Gas stoves will be most beneficial. Wipe off, put in dishwasher and replace! It‚Äôs that simple.",20
positive,Worked great. You will need all the wires and clips from your old ice maker.,20
positive,To all of you out there wondering if these work with the new Mr Coffee 12 cup coffee maker they do!,20
positive,"The only issue this time is slow delivery, I am not sure why.  But I've used the product previously and never been disappointed with it.",20
positive,Absolutely love it!!! Pricey but worth the money. Even husband loves it. Don‚Äôt even need ice maker in the fridge now. Lol,20
negative,"One was cracked when it arrived, straight out of the box. Luckily, I only really needed one to replace one of the shelves in our refrigerator. It was way more of a hassle to try and ship both of them back, so I just let it be since the second one wasn't cracked. It suits its purpose, fits well, I just wish I was able to keep the second one, too.",20
positive,Oem fit and fraction of cost. Win-win,20
positive,Fit perfectly at a great price.,20
positive,This was the exact part I needed for my dryer. Once my husband open the back of our dryer is was very easy to replace. My dryer works like new.,20
positive,This valve arrived promptly and fit right. It did not leak like others I have tried. Good price. Saved tons of money over professional repairs.,20
positive,"This washer has changed my life. It‚Äôs a truly amazing little washer that has a lot of volume and power. I wash all of my adult cloths in it, even smaller blankets and queen size sheets. The spinner fits about a third of the washer capacity but is powerful and effective. I would buy this again. It‚Äôs a great, reliable machine for the price. I can lift it into my bath tub and when done store it away in a closet.",20
positive,Took a little experimenting to accomplish the installation sequence. After installed fit perfectly.,20
positive,Igniter is exact replacement/perfect fit both mounting and electrical connectors. Works as it should. Was well packed and shipped quickly.,20
negative,Black: Did not fit 2.0,20
negative,We only use it on the weekends at our cottage. It only lasted 1 month and stopped working. Got another one and didn‚Äôt work at all! We are done with IGLOO we will find something else.,20
negative,"Just replaced this model with a GE because it died for the THIRD time (that's right - third!) after 3 years. It died two other times before that, but it was within the first year so it was covered under warranty. I didn't even call to see if it could be fixed a third time because I would have had to sink more money into it and clearly it was not long for this world. It was a loud, poor running fridge when it WAS running anyway. I bought it online and although it looked pretty nice in the photo, it was very cheaply made. I guess you get what you pay for - lesson learned.",20
positive,worked perfectly as described for my electric range,20
negative,Ordered right product but one of the coil arm is bent.  Not very happy to receive a new item in this condition.  Thank Donna,20
positive,"I love how quickly it dispenses ice! The first time I watched it I was amazed, now I use it once a week and store the ice in my freezer.",20
positive,Perfect replacement for my old Silverware Basket,20
positive,I have purchased these on a couple of occasions so far so good have had no issues and they work just fine.,20
positive,"This is excellent product and worth bit extra money than others in $300 - 400 range. Stylish, elegant and powerful and quite fan. Washable stainless steel filters are the best as they don't need to be replaced and just can be washed in dishwasher. There is nice oil tray inside as well.<br />Highly recommend this product and it is truly quality American product I would say.",20
positive,These reusable k cups are a huge money saver. Why buy expensive k cups when you can use your own grounds? It makes a great cup of coffee and clean up is easy with the filters. I just wash them it out after use and let it dry overnight and it's ready the next morning.,20
negative,This belt was garbage it only lasted 4 months now have to do it again,20
positive,"All you can expect from just a duct part, fast delivery, good price, perfect fit and good quality!, will definitely recommend it!.",20
negative,I cannot get it to run the hose that goes into dryer vent it's not getting enough pressure to turn on switch I will have to wire it to a light switch somehow.,20
negative,"Was disappointed from the moment I tried it.  I followed the directions to the letter, even going out and buying the appropriate bucket.  I washed a single sock at first.  The machine didn't agitate anything but me.  I wondered if it was too small of a load, so one by one, I added just small socks, removed them, tried other clothes, nothing... All it did was shake my house and give me a migraine.  I ended up hand washing all of my clothes.  The second (and last) time, I put a couple boxers and socks in the bucket, filled it up with soapy water and the device, and almost instantly, I heard a mechanical snap and water flew everywhere.  The top, rotating part of the device sheared off, FLYING out of the bucket, hitting my bathroom mirror, chipping it!  Doubt the seller is going to refund me the $550 I need to replace the mirror, so the best I can do is warn others... DO NOT BUY!!! It may be a bit pricier, but just buy a hand crank washing device, they're about $70 on here, even with inflation.  And these jerks have the audacity to require the device back, inconveniencing me and my husband because of their bad product... When they can't and SHOULDN'T try to fix and resell it.  Dudes... Just refund me.  I'll be calling Amazon for such a request.  After they see these pics... Do you think I'm lying?<br /><br />Less than 1 star for both the product and the seller.  Be and feel ashamed.",20
positive,Fits perfectly in my Whirlpool fridge and is much cheaper than their name brand.,20
positive,"Needed original OEM filter for my Samsung fridge. This fit perfectly and is exactly what I needed.  Perfect, always stick with OEM parts.",20
positive,Easy fix but do 2 at a time.  I leaned the washer back and did the front ones then leaned it forward to do the back ones.  No more bumping and pounding in the laundry room from the washer.,20
positive,Just the right size,20
negative,Wrong size for the frig way too small,20
positive,"Awesome, I was nervous at first purchasing it but its great.",20
positive,"Part worked perfectly, and washer was fixed in 10 min.  Saved literally hundreds of $$$$.",20
positive,"I read reviews before I bought this and almost didn't purchase, however, I had a friend that owns one and had 0 issues so I got it. So glad I did. It is not a feeezer and you need to use ice or move to a ice bucket or it just melts and recycles. It make 2 different sizes and will make ice within just 5 to 7 minutes. I absolutely love it. I think the negative reviews I read just didn't understand how to use it. It has auto shut off when full or out of water. What melts recycles and makes more ice automatically. Excellent product worth every penny!",20
positive,"This replacement glass was just what we needed. It does not have the color tint that the original one did. However, who cares it's in the refrigerator with stuff stacked in it! What mattered was it fit and had no sharp edges that would cut someone while cleaning it! I recommend this replacement item!",20
positive,"Love this little machine! My only regret is that I waited this long to buy it. I've been living in my Manhattan apartment for years and have been sending my laundry out. Ever since moving to NYC I've missed having my own washer/dryer in my apartment. This washer is life changing! Just hook it up to the kitchen faucet, turn it on and forget about it. It's like having a real washing machine. Auto wash, auto rinse, auto spin. Then just hang your clothes to dry. I use it for light-weight work clothes and delicates that I normally would hang to dry anyway. The spin cycle is so good that they are all dry in the morning in time for work. I still send out my towels, sheets and blankets because anything heavy/cotton just comes out too crunchy unless it's put into a proper dryer with heat. But I simply ADORE using this machine for all my other clothes! It washes thoroughly and is gentle on clothes too. I just wish I knew this thing existed years ago! Perfect for any New Yorker w/o laundry in their apartment or building. Just be sure not to let your super or nosy neighbors in on your secret. :)",20
positive,"Exactly what I expected, keeps my cooler full all summer.",20
positive,finally i got the perfect size,20
negative,"It doesn't work, it leak water all over, also it leaks the ground coffee to the cup. I couldn't use it all",20
positive,Simple to install. Water and ice taste great again,20
positive,"besides is easy to install, it look pretty",20
positive,this was a gift for my mother for Christmas. she received it before Christmas and she loves it. it was exactly what she wanted. thank you and merry christmas,20
positive,"Couldn't ask for more.  It fits, and holds my ketchup bottles.<br /><br />I recommend buying this one to replace one you've broken.",20
positive,FAST SHIPPING GREAT PRODUCT,20
positive,"Replaced the filter in my Whirlpool refrigerator<br />Direct fit<br />Immediately noticed the improvement in water flow, taste,  and ice cube quality<br />Will purchase again",20

positive,Works great,20
positive,EXCELLENT PRODUCT,20
positive,"Just really like this. Easy to set up, Super quiet. Just no complaints! Thanks",20
positive,This unit replaced our ice maker in our maytag refrigerator and worked great.,20
negative,Burnt wire smell after 60 days of use and it completely quit working after 90 days of use. I‚Äôll be going back to using Keurig. I thought I could trust the cuisenart brand,20
negative,Ice maker makes loud noise when refilling after installing this filter.,20
positive,It‚Äôs easy to use and give coffee state good.,20
positive,"I've only washed 5 loads so far and this washer has worked very well. The instructions read to only use powder detergent but liquid seems to work just fine. The washer is very quiet IMO. I also love that I was able to move it around by myself since I live alone. Keep in mind though that the washer is 70 lbs and I'm not exactly weak and/or infirm so moving it wasn't extremely difficult for me.<br /><br />So far this little washer has been great and, believe me, I'll update my review if anything changes. üëç",20
positive,These are mt second order for these. I‚Äôve been using them for three years and now I needed a set for our vacation home. I use the paper filter inserts with them and it makes cleaning so easy.,20
positive,It is so nice to have a refillable cup that works in with the newer Keurig 2.0 systems.  It makes the options endless because you can mix different types of coffee to create your own unique flavors!!  I love the convenience..... no more working around the proprietary 2.0 digital readers on the 2.0 systems!  A lower price would be nice.... I would then stock up on a few of these.,20
negative,I bought these because I had coffee left over from the coffee pot. I found them to be hard to fill and when you put them in the K cup machine and close the lid it is hard to close and when you open the lid the container lid comes off so you have to dig it out of the machine.,20
positive,"Perfect pitcher, perfect size for our water usage at the table, very light and easy to clean!",20
positive,"Does what i bought it for! Perfect fit! no problem with installing, got here on time good service. Would Recommend",20
positive,I have put my hand stopp for move it it's do move its alot its move its self,20
negative,The wine cooler came on. Fan would blow. But no cooling. Sent product back to Amazon. We are waiting on new unit to see if it will work.,20
positive,Easy to swap just like the factory one. Will buy more as they are 1/3 of the price of the factory ones.,20
positive,Works great very durable and holds a decent amount of silverware,20
positive,"Worked fine once I received the right element. There are different size of connections, the 1st was not correct.",20
negative,This peace didn‚Äôt work‚Ä¶ It wouldn‚Äôt catch the thread on the screw. It was weird it would screw on backwards but not the way it was intended to. It was useless. O well,20
negative,@ Best it might hold 4 eggs (1 in each corner) vs 6. 2 side byside same row.. Eggs broke.. See H. Lundberg review.,20
positive,I've bought several of these in various sizes. Expensive but really good quality. Launders well,20
negative,"This part does not fit, even though I verified that it's supposed to fit by using the dropdown with the model number and brand.  DO NOT RECOMMEND.",20
positive,Easy to install.,20
negative,One of the wheels keeps falling off. You get what you pay for,20
positive,Don't fall for those manufacturer solicitations for water filter replacements at huge prices. These will work just as well and will not break the bank.,20
positive,Just like advertises,20
positive,Easy to read,20
positive,I have a hard water issue so wicking filters don't last long. However these are the best of any that I have tried. I've tried several. They are a little more expensive but very well made and last much longer. As long as Amazon sells these it will be what I buy.,20
positive,Wrong item for my dryer.,20

negative,Major hassle to install,20
negative,"I have a Whirlpool Refrig. and what's good about it is I don't have to drive 7 miles to get it.  The service is fast but lately it hasn't last<br />long.  I checked my past account and noticed I just bought it on Sept.4th, 2017.  Now the refrigerator is telling that I will soon have to put in<br />a new one.  It has only been 3 months!  Is there something wrong with this filter?",20
negative,"They have changed their definition of custom fit so it's not the same as previous orders.  In 2020 when I ordered I received a truly custom fitting piece (pictured) to cover my rangetop's large and small burner as well as the center burner.  The new on ordered in 2022 (pictured) is a more generic version made to cover small and large burners with the same large cut outs.  I am not sure that this will be as effective over time, but time will tell.  I we get away with crusty burn buildup on exposed areas of the range top then I will change my ratings.",20
positive,I just feel that thirty five bucks is a lot to pay for a little piece of plastic.  But they had it and I didn't.  I guess that the basis for all economics.,20
positive,I love this! It is easy to slide and clearly shows clean or dirty dishes in dishwasher. I chose this one because I loved the modern design. I am very adamant about clean looks and style. It looks great on my dishwasher.,20
positive,Had for a couple years and it works great. It is a little small but we can keep up with the laundry for a family of 3. I highly recomend for anyone that needs a small compact washer.,20
positive,You can't really go wrong with these filters. They fit the Aeropress perfectly and keep the coffee grounds from getting into the coffee. I would love to see better perforations similar to what Melita does however this is not really a must have. I bought the pack of 700 (which is two of the 350 packs together. It will last me for quite a while. I have an Aeropress at home and one at work so I can always enjoy the quality coffee wherever I may be. I even take them with me on vacation.,20
positive,Very good filters,20
positive,Quality and affordable,20
positive,"I try to be eco conscious,  but my reusable filter just wasn't cutting it.  It left little bits of coffee grounds behind and I didn't like that I had to wash it by hand.  These are much easier to use.  They filter out all of the grounds and when I am finished,  I can just toss it in the garbage.",20
negative,not easy to connect,20
positive,"great price, fast shipping",20
positive,I ordered these filters for my smaller coffeemaker and they were a perfect size.<br /><br />They are sturdy enough for the coffee grounds and work just fine.<br /><br />I would recommend them to anyone needing the smaller sized filters.,20
positive,Installation was easy and it works as expected. I wish more products were like this. Thank you.,20
positive,"Perfect!  We put it in upside down/backwards the first time, but once we turned it around, the door worked perfectly again!  YAY!",20
positive,"I love my Keurig but love my coffee from Papua New Guinea, too.  This allows me to create my own pod.  The attached top is better because it is cleaner.",20
negative,"The shaft was defective ,the seal seat came off<br />The seals are low quality<br />The washer did not fit the shaft ,had to use the old one<br />The spacer tube was very low quality.",20
positive,great value does the job well,20
positive,Part fit perfectly. Easy to install. Not sure on durability as it‚Äôs only been in a couple days but I have more confidence in the ball bearing design than the original bushing setup.,20
positive,This worked on my Maytag fridge!  Easy to install.  Cheaper than the one on the Maytag website.,20
positive,"We had our LG LMXS27626X for about 3 years. The original tray that the ice cubes cracked due to the constant thaw and refreeze of the ice cube tray (mostly due to the flap where the ice comes out and into your cup not closing all the way). We started hearing this loud clicking from the ice not being able to drop out of the tray, so decided we better replace the whole unit.<br /><br />I liked how perfectly this fit my refrigerator. It was very easy to install. It‚Äôs been working great-0 problems.",20
positive,Good quality,20
positive,A most for any humidor.,20
positive,Replace old filter for Kuerig,20
negative,"Not what I expected an MUCH to costly to return.  SO, make sure it is what you want before ordering!",20
positive,Didn‚Äôt like $6 shipping. Otherwise glad I bought the 24 pack instead of just 12,20
positive,I‚Äôve used this for 2 years and it still works great!,20
positive,I deployed this to the crawlspace to keep an eye on the humidity and temperature.  We have a dehumidifier and this device helps me understand that it is working as it should.  If the humidity is out of the established range I get an alert and can check to make sure the dehumidifier is in good working order.,20
negative,sad but true they didn't really work to wick the water up for the humidifier,20
positive,"Good news, the switch itself fit perfectly and that part of the installation was truly simple.<br />Not so easy. The plug on the unit did not fit the receptor on the Kenmore 80 series. I was able to take the plug off my broken switch and use it on the new unit by connecting the appropriate wires (gray wires to black wires and green wire to green). It is just a simple switch. I am still satisfied with the product overall since it was about $10 and the official unit would have cost about $50.",20
negative,Not having a top flap causes the coffee to spill into the machine and your coffee cup. Very annoying when disposing the used coffee.,20
positive,Exactly what the description says,20
positive,"Filters works perfectly, really glad I bought them for my Samsung refrigerator. No leaks. Saved too much money compared to the Samsung filters.",20
negative,I use these to cover both my washer and dryer. The covers are durable and easy to use. I would recommend to anyone who wants to cover their appliances,20
positive,It works,20
negative,Water dispenser shows error with filter. Too late to return. Doh!,20
positive,Excellent replacement parts for my Keurig coffee maker,20
positive,Wow these disposable filters are great! Fit nicely and keeps clean up to a minimum. Will definitely be re-ordering in the future. Saves a lot of time.,20
positive,I love this,20
positive,"When you travel in Europe you are often given instant coffee at your Airbnb, often in pods with a machine like a Kurig.<br />This gadget solved my problem as it packs easily with the filters in very little space.  I bring my favorite brand of coffee and don't feel like my morning is ruined by instant coffee.<br />The trick to getting a good cup of coffee is to wet the filter before you put in the coffee.  If you don't the boiling water goes through too quickly.  Wet the filter first and that allows the coffee to brew.",20
positive,Father-in-law cannot tell we switched his coffee,20
positive,Couldn't find a better deal!<br />Works great!,20
positive,Works really well. Easy to use. I always have ice thanks to this portable ice machine. I'm happy!!,20

positive,Good,20
negative,"I ordered this part because of the price. It looks exactly what my dryer uses. First, don't know why, it was hard to get the belt back on. Worked great for about 2 weeks, then we started hearing a small squeak. Next a big squeak. About 3 weeks after installing the plastic part just fell apart. So we are thinking it's the belt because we had just replaced it about a month ago, maybe it was too small. Get the dryer back apart, nope it wasn't the belt, the belt was an OEM. So I call a local parts replacement company. I tell the guy what happened, he asks if I got the part off Amazon, says he hears these stories all day. So replaced this part,  belt goes on just fine and no squeaks. Dryer running like new again. The price was 15.00 more but worth every penny.",20
negative,"[[VIDEOID:4f04684ebb9884009b1ccf8658622587]] so Far Not so good.....  looks structurally sound and usable but not a good fit on my Ninja Coffee Maker.  The video I posted will explain it all.  Smaller then original... tab on left instead of center which causes it to sit crooked in the basket. I imagine it will still work and will know on next brew. If its not any good I will repost with a 1 star and do a return, but until then all good considering this was over a $10 savings to the original one which also had like $6 shipping.",20

positive,Love this tiny work horse. Bought this for my sailboat. Puts out ice about 4 minutes after we get on boat. Perfect for when we get on boat. Immediately turn on machine. By time  we get our stuff full on boat and get settled there‚Äôs plenty ice for my wife and I to have a drink. LOVE IT!! Had for 4 months. Kind of loud. Put out a little heat.  But so so compact and def good purchase.,20

positive,"Sure it's beautiful with handsome styling, but it's also so much more.<br /><br />Some of my favorite features include the two multi-size burners, warming zone, and melt function.  All the burners, including the power boil (yes, that's right) heat up well and function very efficiently.  Along with the electronic display are some stainless knobs that I think lend a richer look than the black ones.<br /><br />The oven cooks evenly (there were some minor fumes briefly during its first use).  And of the two cleaning options this model offers, I'll definitely choose steam clean as opposed to the energy hog self clean.  It's also nice that GE engineered the heating element off the oven floor.<br /><br />I haven't had any difficulty at all keeping the black cook top clean.  But if I do, I'll just use Wieman Glass Cook Top Cleaner, which out-performs Cerama Bryte (comes with GE ranges) by a mile.<br /><br />Now if this model had a dedicated clock pad, it would be absolutely perfect.  Then, I wouldn't have to push so many unrelated buttons to set, display, or turn off the clock.<br /><br />All things considered, though, this is a great looking / performing range and I'd definitely recommend it.",20

Devised a ring to hold the upper part of these filters open when brewing as they sometimes would collapse when loaded with smaller amounts of coffee. Filters work quite well - no residue gets through them, only brewed coffee. These 1000 filters are enough to last nearly three years and at a great price from Amazon.",20

The stove is in a duplex rental so if the tenants take it easy on the knobs they should last, but who expects that?",20

positive,"It is an exact replacement for the old one in my ""only"" two year old Frigidaire, top freezer fridge.  Squeeze the connection plug in the back and unplug it.  Then remove two screws (very small socket needed) and it is out.  Install the new just reverse.  Could be done in 15 minutes or less.  Only difficulty is seeing the screws, especially one.  You either need a mirror or have to stick you head all the way into the freezer to see them.  It has to cool to the freezer temperature before it will begin working.  Made the first ice in about 8 hours.  It is the same cheap looking unit that was OEM, so guess it also will die in a couple years.  However for the price and ease of swapping it out, guess I'll live with that.",20

positive,"[[VIDEOID:33bae3bca0811e36b1abe944f7791242]]Update: Suddenly the unit started drying all types of clothes from socks and jeans to towels and sheets perfectly. Even the inside pockets of jeans in a full load are dry. We didn't change anything, and it performed as described below for over a year the same way every time. I don't know what happened, honestly. I'll update this review again if something changes, or provide details on how to fix a drying issue if I can ever figure out what happened.<br /><br />I poked around the washer and realized that my drain pipe was higher than the washer recommends. The washer recommends that the hose positioned at the same level as the unit or below. Fortunately I had another drain option and repositioned the drain from the higher one to the lower one. Performance is still good on drying.<br />____________<br /><br />Regarding the issue of drying, which I think is the most important piece of deciding whether or not to purchase the unit, the short version in my case is that most fabrics that are washed and then dried need to be placed on a drying rack. I'll detail my complete experience below.<br /><br />My situation is simple. I live with my fiancee and a small dog in a small condo where the only option for a washer and dryer would have been this combined unit or the specialized Bosch washer/dryer units for small spaces. I work in an office and my fiancee works on a farm with horses. All of our clothes always come out clean, and we have not had any technical issues with the unit.<br /><br />Washing -<br />This machine is a proficient washer. There are more modes and settings than most people will probably need, but for everything I've put in there (jeans, t-shirts, dish towels, regular towels, sheets, light blankets) the basic setting works well. Items that the dog has soiled with urine are cleaned by adding specific cleaners on top of the regular dosing of detergent.<br /><br />I always wash clothes with the cold water temperature setting as I don't feel it is necessary to wash clothes with warm or hot water, although those options are available to you if you want them. I don't use detergent designed for cold washing, just unscented Arm and Hammer, but if you are concerned about it I believe companies have produced detergents with enzymes designed to activate at lower temperatures. The unit uses water efficiently as it continually sprays clothes with jets of water, tumbles, and repeats until the cycle has finished. This differs from conventional top-load washers where the basin is filled with water and your clothes are rotated in that water.<br /><br />The system has some bright lights to illuminate the drum even if you have no other light source.<br /><br />Drying-<br />This unit is certainly not a powerful dryer, and drying will take a few hours. The more you fill the drum the longer it will take to dry. There are some fabrics, mostly polyester I think, that will actually come out dry enough to put away. However, things that are made with thick cotton will need to be dried on a rack. The articles that come out the most damp for me are underwear and socks. Jeans and towels come out reasonably dry, but will still need a few hours on a rack. Given that most clothes need to be dried on a rack, you won't be able to get the dryer soft feel.<br /><br />Drying comes as a bonus, as I would otherwise have no options for a dryer in my condo, so although it does not perform as well as a regular unit, I think its acceptable.<br /><br />I haven't tried to get clothes to come out of the unit wrinkle-free, but there seem to be settings to achieve that.<br /><br />Other considerations-<br />The unit performs what I expect it to do, but there are a few other factors that I feel are important to mention.<br /><br />There can be an issue of mold growing in your unit if you close the door after use and do not clean the rubber that seals the door. However, if you purchase the unit you will notice that the door, much like a car door, has two positions, part-way open and full-open. If you slowly close the door from full-open you will feel it come to rest in a position with a small space left for air to pass. This is enough for the drum to dry out between uses, which solves the problem of mold growth. Watch the uploaded video for a demonstration of this.<br /><br />The unit has a nice feel to it. The buttons are solid, the moving parts lock into place, and it rewards you with nice chimes when you turn it on, change a setting, set it to run, and when it turns off. It's absolutely silly, but the ending song is actually pleasant to hear. I actually find myself looking forward to hearing it. LG seems to have adopted this musical feature in their appliances and I think its a good decision that shows they are thinking about the details of design as well as the big picture.",20

positive,Great replacement for lost dishwasher parts.,20
positive,Value for the money,20
negative,The material is similar to plastic material. Initially they worked well but over time they caught heat and started melting. It doesn‚Äôt fit all stoves same and had to use scissors to cut the hole to fit the burner. It sometimes catches fire on high flames. Cleaning does become easier but has its disadvantages.,20

I was in the market for a budget fridge in the 42 to 53 quart size range. I picked this one up on a lightening deal for 288.  It works great and I like the fact that they warranty the compressor for 3 years. It is very efficient and actually pulls a little less wattage than stated. I used it on a camping trip and ran it with  my Yetti 400. It worked great.<br />I would suggest setting the temperature about 5 degrees less than your desired temp. It seems a little off.<br /><br />The only complaint I have about this fridge is the handles. They are sturdy but the metal handles are loose in the plastic mounts and they can rattle around. A little tape around the ends should fix that and  they do stick out a little. If they had the same style of handles as the  BougeRV 53 quart, it would make this the perfect budget fridge!",20

The instructions say that it will take longer to complete the first ice-making cycle when running for the first time. I found this to be true, but it sped of SIGNIFICANTLY after that first cycle. It makes ice with the holds in the middle.<br /><br />I've never tried to make small ice cubes, because after making medium and large (they look fairly similar), I knew I wouldn't want anything smaller. If you're new to counter top ice makers, remember that it only MAKES the ice. You can't store it here permanently and keep it frozen. You still have to remove it and store somewhere to keep it frozen. However, if it melts in here, I think it would just recycle that water and make new ice. I'd highly recommend it.",20

positive,"This product is truly amazing.  I have a dryer that is fit into a tight closet.  As a result, it cannot easily be moved.  Instead, I carefully measured the run length of the metal duct up to the elbow coming out of the dryer exhaust and marked the last rod with tape to make sure the length wasn't too long or short.  I then removed the dryer vent cap on the outside of the house, inserted the lint eater plug into the vent pipe and connected the shop vac after starting the dryer.  I have a 22' run so you need to connect a only a few rods at a time.  its s process but not complicated.  The exhaust coming out of the vent is like a roar.

Had the product been made with the same quality of the units we were trying to replace; it is likely they would have survived the shipping (which was unboxed - only bubble wrapped) just fine.  I am guessing these units are intended for rental replacements (to get damage deposits back) but are wholly unsatisfactory for home owners trying to return their stove tops to a clean/sleek look.  Additionally, due to their material thinness - not entire sure I would feel comfortable that they are as safe/robust as they should be.",20

negative,Unfortunately I have to give this a one-star review because unless you're making one or two cups of coffee this device will overflow and your coffee will be loaded with coffee grounds it was easy to clean and for the coffee that I was able to make it tasted fine but it's just not a useful item for a full pot of coffee. I used normal coffee grounds from store bought ground coffee..Folgers and DD.,20

negative,"We‚Äôve got a son who eats a lot of eggs, so I thought this would be an appropriate addition to our refrigerator.  Has the obvious benefit of seeing how many eggs are left compared to a regular egg carton (he‚Äôs a teenager and will leave 1 or 2 eggs in the original container without letting us know to get more).  The description also says it has a ‚Äú7 degree slope‚Äù so the eggs will run downhill to the front, which, in theory, seems nice.  I also hate the sound/feel of styrofoam, so to get rid of that would be a plus.<br /><br />It shipped immediately and the plastic is sturdy/good quality.  No directions, although it‚Äôs not rocket science to figure out how to assemble.  It‚Äôs bigger than I anticipated, but that‚Äôs on me as the dimensions are clearly stated in the description.  The issue with the size, though, is that you are giving up a more efficient container (the egg carton) that is opaque for one that you can see through, but ultimately takes up much more space horizontally and vertically.  I'm not sure that I want to commit that much refrigerator space to just eggs.  Also, where we kept our eggs before will not accommodate the 2 level container, and I am positive that eggs aren‚Äôt important enough to get ‚Äúmain floor‚Äù placement, so we are only going with 1 level.<br /><br />The main problem for me is that the ‚Äú7 degree slope‚Äù doesn‚Äôt seem to be enough to consistently get the eggs to roll forward.  I tried multiple shelves and even our counter, but unless there is a little encouragement (ie - tilting the tray forward), the eggs will roll to the back just as frequently as to the front when the front rows eggs are removed or the tray is put back in the fridge when not full.  You can see on the last picture I took, but the eggs will just stay in the back when front ones are removed.  I tried both trays to be sure, but they were both equal.  When you add the second level, though, there is a little plastic spacer that tilts the top tray even more, and those eggs run much more freely to the front.  The bottom level remains the same.  I think their baseline tilt needs to be increased a few degrees.<br /><br />We are going to give it a little time, but I bet we go back to regular cartons (and the dreaded squeak of styrofoam when they aren‚Äôt cardboard).<br /><br />Of note, I received 3 emails from the seller within 2 days of the order.  I‚Äôm not sure if that is very nice or annoying, but they were very eager to help with any issues or problems.",20

Because I have always been pleased with the results I have continued to reorder them even if therre are other pod filters at a lower price. Unfortunately, the company's quality control has been degrading. With every box I buy, I get more and more filters that either won't completley seal, even after several tries, or they come unsealed while waiting to be used. This makes a big mess at my coffee station and clogs up my Senseo machine, sometimes causing the machine to leak around the seal.

It's a bit of a pain to clean so I thought I would try the #1 filters that it said were compatible. The filter is really too big to fit inside the filter basket and it's difficult to close the lid over top of the paper filter. Coffee grounds still get all over the inside of the lid. A little easier to clean overall, but these filters cost more then other more popular sizes.",20

The drain hose that came with it sprang a leak for the first wash so we bought a sturdier hose to use with it. The washer cleans really well and spins the clothing almost dry. You have to be very careful with delicate clothing, maybe use a lingerie bag with bras and lacy items. I have used the washer about 5 times now and I am happy with it.<br /><br />My husband and I have been living in our RV full-time for 4 months. I wash 5 to 7 loads of laundry every week and have had zero problems with the Panda. I can wash a set of king-size sheets easily. This washer is sturdy and well built. I am very happy with the PAN615SG.<br />Update: 9/30/18<br />Washer still going strong after 2 yrs of use. I noticed last week, after finishing up the week's laundry, that mold was growing up the side of the spin tub container.

So if you're using a standard washing machine connecting hose you need a MALE 3/4"" PIPE to MALE HOSE adapter(s) or a combo to achieve same. That's about the only bad news.<br /><br />Please note that I've had this for well over a year and its installed in a highly modified travel trailer that I live in (thus it gets a lot of usage). It does a good job of washing but I do not load it heavily which I believe is a secret to longevity as most everything in this is fabricated out of plastic except for the tub and most of the running gear. Also if you're ""handy"" you can reverse the side that it drains from. its default drain hose exits from starboard rear but I converted it to port rear. I didn't have to modify any of the exterior housing either. Oh. Previously I left a review that stated it leaked. I later discovered that the leak was from one of my fittings upstream from the unit's water input (as several adapters were used).",20

positive,"My Samsung dryer dv45h7000 suddenly stopped heating. It was spinning, just no heat.  After Googling it, I narrowed it down to either a clogged vent (possibly causing overheating and a blown dryer fuse) or the heating element dying (which apparently this model is known for). I am a 52 y.o. mom, relatively handy, but have never attempted anything like this. So after a little further research, I determined that my vents were not clogged. So that left me with a dead heating element. After viewing several YouTube tutorials on how to remove the part from the dryer, I gathered up my tools and disassembled the dryer enough to remove the part. Several tutorials recommend that you take out the drum. I really did not want to go this far. I was able to pull the part out of the bottom right corner without having to remove the drum. I reinstalled the new part easily and before I completely reassembled it I plugged it in and tested it to make sure that it was blowing heat. BINGO!! IT WORKED! if you are attempting this for the first time on your own, I would recommend doing your research beforehand and watching several YouTube videos to see how different people did it.

You will need a grinder as industrial scissors will not work and you will probably ruin the metal.  If you need to cut it, get some cardboard (e.g., at Michael's) and create a template.  Then trace the template onto the metal.  Use several layers of green/blue painters tape where you need to cut to protect the metal.  One thing to note about this metal, there are NO holes and the corners are slightly rounded (picture is not accurate).  In the end, if you are looking for a large piece of stainless steel for a highly visible location (like a backsplash), you will not be disappointed with this professional grade stainless steel.",20

positive,"Like the rest of you who have a Krups Mocka Brew, I think its fantastic! Nevertheless, there are only so many of us, at least in North America. For whatever reason, Krups does not aggressively market the Moka Brew and does not sell as many Moka Brews as its other (inferior) models. Maybe its because of the instability of Krups' management/owenership. Frankly, I don't know any more which conglomerate owns Krups today. Is it still Lucifer (P&G)?<br /><br />When demand is small as compared to ,for example, #4 filters, you don't have many companies making filters for the Moka Brew. I don't know of anyone besides Krups who makes filters specifically for the Moka Brew. Also, you can't get permanent gold filters either.<br /><br />I'm no economist, but with small demand and small supply, you get higher prices as compared to filter sizes where there is competition. Krups essentially has a monopoly. They can charge whatever they want.<br /><br />Under these circumstances, I am very grateful that they make a high quality filter. They could try to get by with an inferior quality product, but they don't. The filter sold on Amazon is, in fact, of better quality as compared to the quality of other filters (#2 & #4) I have bought in the past.<br /><br />I understand that they might sell more Moka Brews to the Euros. Maybe someone else will start making filters and we'll have some good 'ol competition. Until then, be thankful that someone at Krups understands that Moka Brew customers expect quality, and we get it with the Krups Moka Brew Filters.",20

Not the case. I should have read the most recent reviews.<br /><br />We just bought a 4-pack of these filters and I tried to install one today. As I attempted to lock it into place, I heard a hissing sound.  At first I thought it was just the filter filling with water... My mistake, it was the lower pan of my refrigerator compartment filling with water.  I realized this as it started to drip from the bottom of the drawer.  The only good news is from all the cleanup is that I now have a clean pantry drawer.<br /><br />I replaced the filter with the initial Samsung filter I'd taken out and the leaking stopped.

negative,"Overall, this unit does the job of cooking food, but it has some issues. First, the starter only works about 1/2 the time. Not a big deal, since I keep an extention lighter near by. My unit came with the cast iron burner elements covered in gold spraypaint for some reason. They smoked and stank the first few times I tried to cook with the unit. I'm guessing the fumes are not at all good for you and probably not something you want billowing up around your food. The four spoke pan supports don't offer a lot of stability to your pots and pans, especially smaller ones, 8&#34; or less. They tend to slip off because the spokes don't extend far enough toward the center. Five or six spokes, each an inch longer, would be a significant improvement. The inner and outer ring of each element has an airflow adjuster under the glass surface. In my experience, the knobs and air adjustments don't give enough control. Even on the lowest setting, the center element has a high flame that will burn the food in the center of the pot or pan unless I turn the pressure way down at the tank regulator. Forget about a low simmer unless you are willing to monkey with the primary regulator. This unit is also bigger than it looks in the photos. The given dimensions are accurate, though, so lay out a piece of cardboard or the equivalent to get a sense of the actual scale before you order it. In retrospect, I probably could have chosen a smaller/cheaper unit and been just as satisfied.",20

Hopefully this one will last 10 year like the last motor. Replacement was very simple. (Cut the power from the breaker first!) Remove a couple screws to take the lid and the electric panel off. Unplug 3 wire clips (suggest taking notes or a photo first to verify they go back on the same way). One bolt to remove the fan, then 4 nuts on the back to remove the old motor and mount the new one. The new motor came pre-wired with the right clips, so it was a super easy replacement. It probably only took 20 minutes total.

positive,Easy to install,20
positive,These are nicer than the actual plastic knobs that were on the stove.  They are a little shinier than the old ones but also heavier and appear more durable.,20
positive,I replaced Frozen belt tension pulley assembly. Belt wore through pulley. Hopefully this will last the rest of the life of the dryer. Only had dryer for 4 years with low usage.,20
positive,I love that these coffee filters are reusable. The coffee tastes great and it‚Äôs easy to clean,20
negative,"I've attached a photo of what I mean.<br /><br />The beige dial on the right is my old one, which cracked. Noticed that the flat part (facing right) is noticeably flat because it takes up more the ""circle"" center.<br /><br />The white dial on the left is the one I ordered. Note that the flat area (facing right) is far smaller because because less of the ""circle"" center is truncated by the flat part.<br /><br />The one I expected to get should have been just like my original, judging by the part number and the photos provided for this Amazon listing. However, it is not. You can see that the one I received (again, the one on the left) is NOT the same as the one pictured.<br /><br />As a result, it fits loosely on my dryer. It works -- for now -- but with about a half-inch of ""looseness"" in both directions, rather than being a snug fit that accurately shows the dial's position.<br /><br />Very disappointed. I'd give it one star (false advertising) but at least it ""kind of"" works.",20

positive,The description is spot on. Just what I needed.,20
negative,"Bought this last April, and now it stopped working again after one year..",20
negative,Bad product; very hard to install and the instructions are not helpful at all.,20
negative,"This is a very late review as I forgot about reviewing this. This filter spewed out charcoal, I assume it was charcoal, for nearly the entirety of it being in the fridge. It worked great for about a week, then the smell came. At first I thought it was food in the fridge. So, I cleaned it out, dumped the ice from the icemaker tray, scrubbed everything down with water and bleach and washed it again with dishsoap. Still a horrendous smell. We put up with it for a couple weeks before I finally went down to Lowe's and bought a GE filter as there were none on Amazon with my prime shipping. After I pulled the filter out, I put it to my nose and it smelled like mold and something rotting in it.<br /><br />It was sealed. So, I don't know what it could have been. The GE brand has never had this issue. It's more expensive for the GE brand, but well worth it as it doesn't smell rancid after 2 weeks.<br /><br />I may have just received the oddball, but I'm sticking with GE.",20
positive,I saved some money.instead of buying the door handle.,20
positive,Right part at the right price.,20
negative,"I didn't use this product, so I can't speak to its effectiveness. It came well packaged and timely.  I'm returning it because the electric dryer is  a little bigger than a hand mixer and (for me) too big for travel.  All of the pieces came intact and the pop up tent folds down small and flat but bigger than a 12 pack of tortillas. I'm trying to return it for a full refund, but the seller is making me jump through email hoops now.  I'll update when it's resolved.",20

positive,"This was Genuine GE badge and looks just like the the original on our GE French Door refrig w/CleanSteel, #GFSL6KKYLS. We used this one to cover a small dent on the right bottom side of the freezer drawer. It comes with self sticking tape on the back side.",20
positive,Really drops the acidity and gives the coffee a smoother taste..<br />It could just be me.. psychological..<br />Really easy to install and maintain..just wish it were made completely of copper or stainless steel,20
negative,The 1 inch end did not fit snugly around the connection to our new Maytag washer and the hose had a leak. Not impressed!,20
negative,"I really wanted to love this washer. But I can't. It arrived before the scheduled date, which was great. The size is exactly what I was looking for. It is made of plastic except for the drum. On the first wash I noticed water pooling underneath it. I took off the back panel and a piece of broken plastic from somewhere inside the machine fell out. Upon looking for the leak, I found that the drainage hose (which is made of pretty thin plastic) has a cut in it and it is leaking. It has me really questioning the longevity of this machine. So, I filed for a return and haven't heard back from them.",20
positive,"First cubes are not worth it dump but wait for it, they come out great. Let a few batches go and put them in a container in freezer.",20

positive,I reviewed over 6 different options.  I kept coming back to this particular range hood. This is a 10 in my opinion.,20
positive,Works and is cheaper,20
negative,Two of the oven caps were bent upon arrival. Still in backseat of car with intent to mail back but so much going on. Someone should've noticed these were damaged before shipping. Very disappointed.  First time I've ordered and item was damaged.,20
positive,Saved a bundle using this replacement part versus hiring an appliance specialist or buying a new dryer.  Thanks a bunch!!!,20
positive,Very good quality product for a decent price.,20
positive,I screwed up and didn‚Äôt read the item specs. This is for round type handles. My appliance handle  are slightly flattened and this doesn‚Äôt fit perfectly like on rounded ones.,20
negative,"Perfect replacement part, but I sure hate being over charged for something made so cheaply.  The price is ridiculous for such a simple item.",20
positive,It's a great part but food for thought. The manufacturer should make parts that plug and play. Seems like a waste of wires and time to continue doing it this way.,20
positive,These are just what you‚Äôd expect. I like how you can see the coffee filling the cup so you know when you‚Äôre full. I think I‚Äôll eventually switch to a stainless steel one to keep from buying paper filters.,20
positive,They work perfectly. It cuts the cost of nespresso pods. Great value for the money.,20
positive,Use it every day,20
positive,"This item looks like a really good quality but did not live to that standard. It fell apart just about 6mo of use and I‚Äôm not even much of a cook. I am really disappointed and if you are reading this review, do yourself a favor. Don‚Äôt by this particular brand. It‚Äôs a waste of money. This item is not durable by any means",20
negative,"I bought these to replace OEM parts which has lost continuity.  The first one died within a few days, but since it was a pack of 2 I was able to replace it right away.  The second one died within another few weeks.  Poor quality, spend the money on better parts.",20
positive,Exactly what I needed and perfect fit,20
positive,Good container but the eggs on the ends are a bit hard to get out.,20
positive,It was a replacement knob. It fit the oven perfectly it was the right color. I thought it was a little expensive for a knob.,20
positive,Didn't notice any difference from the namebrand GE.  Lowest price filter that I could find at time of purchase that filtered not only NSF 42/53 but also filtered out per 372 and 401 guidelines.,20
positive,Nice,20
positive,For my coffee pot love them,20
positive,Prompt shipping and good product at a decent price.,20
positive,What a difference! From old and dingy yellowish to white. Changed the look of our older home‚Äôs bathrooms.,20
positive,This is such a great product to use with your coffee without having to spend a ton of money on the prepared K-Cups. This it's perfectly in the K-Cup dispenser and it works well in filtering out the sediment from the ground coffee,20
positive,"Works fine, large readable display, seems to be fairly accurate.",20
positive,Worked perfectly! Great product,20
negative,"Product works as expected, but price is borderline unreasonable.",20
positive,Works great.,20
negative,"Had it installed today. It took my handyman about 1.5 hrs to install, even though I had a ventless system. No hardware included in package so had to buy my own. Once installed it looked ok except for filter hanging down like a worn out brillo pad bag (shouldn't this be one straight piece, as the one I had before was)? THEN, I turned it on, and the noise was so loud, I though someone was trying to land a plane in my kitchen! The other stuff wasn't impressive but I could live with it (buy another filter), but the noise was the deal-breaker. Unfortunately, it took son long to get someone to install it--between COVID and winter storms--that the return date had passed already by about  2 weeks, and it was no longer eligible for return.",20
positive,Great product. Great fit!,20
positive,"Heat resistant; do prevent crumbs and other items from falling between stove and cupboard. The only negative is that yhey are a little hard to keep clean. But, you can take them off and use soapy water.",20
positive,Perfect fit.  Better quality than the originals.,20
positive,Great product,20
positive,"Think of it as Pinocchio during his transitional phase. Not a toy, not yet a full functioning washer and dryer. That being said, it is a great working solution for those wanting an effective method to clean and spin dry clothing in an apartment or other traditional machine laundering restricted living situation that handles this essential task with efficacy, convenience and ease. The washing cycle unexpectedly provides powerful agitation. The spin cycle is, without exaggeration, incredible in releasing most of the water from the clothing. Please bear in mind that use of this machine requires 4 steps. 1. Wash. 2. Spin Dry (to remove soap and water) 3. Rinse Cycle (back in the washing compartment) 4. Spin Dry (to remove water). Clothes will still need time on a drying rack, but expect them to finish quite quickly since they are lightly damp rather than soaking wet. Instead of installing the fill tube, which is kind of flimsy, I simply use the portable shower head that I bought on Amazon to fill the machine (photo included) with water for the wash and rinse cycles. Before I ordered that part to make those steps easier, I used a bucket, which was tedious but effective. The build is a bit flimsy, which makes me worry about the long term usage. Time will tell. I'll be sure to update in a few months.<br /><br /> It's an impressive machine that gets my genuine recommendation.",20
positive,I thought my installer had read the reviews and followed the instructions but he had not bought a new part for the inside water hose on the back and after 6 months we had a leak. Thankfully I saw it right away. I had him read and follow the tips and we were back in business. Great little machine for the price. Just cheap hose and lines so replace them at installation.  Also know that you will have to defrost every 2 months or so.  I'd buy again instead of spending the $1000 for undercounter kitchen ice machine which I had before and needed service every 3 months.,20
negative,These knobs are listed as stainless steel.  They are silver plastic and poorly made.  I returned them.,20
positive,Works absolutely perfect doesn't slip and slide at all you play sit down and it stays<br />If the gap between your stove and countertop or the Gap itself that you are covering with this product is too large it may fall through you may need a different product but for me this is absolutely perfect,20
positive,We use lots of eggs so this is great!!  The only downfall is the drawer has no stability when pulled out further than halfway.  It's not a deal breaker for us though.,20
positive,They work well !,20
negative,The new Every Drop filters do not filter nearly as well as the old Maytag filters.,20
positive,This was delivered quickly and was a perfect fit on my washer. Looked the exact same as the one I was replacing.,20
positive,We tend to put too much in the doors of our fridge. We have broken 2 of the original Whirlpool ones and these are sturdier and way cheaper replacements,20

positive,Just like other reviews a clip was broken when it came but it worked okay anyway,20
positive,"very good , well built vent. Easy to install. The bast deal for your money by far.",20

Ordered the long twice and was shipped the regular (both of which where as marked long) ordered the regular just to see if they were swapped and nope, just got the regular. The long version is a unicorn never to be seen...",20

positive,"This part was a direct replacement for the ice maker in my Jenn-Air refrigerator.  I was able to swap the unit out in about 20 minutes with no issues.  The included L-bracket that supports the icemaker underneath didn't match the existing hole in my fridge, but I was able to utilize the existing L-bracket from the old unit without issue.  I would recommend this purchase without hesitation.",20
positive,Exact fit for my over the range microwave,20
negative,It burned up in less than a month.  No more getting parts.  Labor not worth it. Buying new dryer.  Last heating element I replaced lasted for years.,20

negative,"EverDrop 1 water filter stuck in Whirlpool Refrigerator with bottom grille access swinging door. This Whirlpool design is a stupid design which only generates $ for their repair techs.  I‚Äôve had 3 service calls in 4 yrs to remove stuck filter.<br />Each time, the tech replaced, or reinstalled the loose white arm that pulls the filter out when you open the grille door.  Today, I used a pair of channel lock pliers myself, with a lot of effort, pulled the filter out.  Water works like new with out filter... save your $40 cost of OEM filter!!<br />If you have great water, like we do in SF area, forget the high priced filters...The system is designed to work w/o a filter..no leaks !!!",20

positive,"I've been using a chemex pot for over 15 years and it's my favorite way to make coffee.  This is a great re-usable filter.  It's easy to lift out (I am very impatient and sometimes need a sip of coffee before it's done dripping!) and I dump the grounds either into my compost or into the flower bed outside the front door so I appreciate how green this is.  No more paper filters to run out of or to pick out of the compost pile. As long as you figure out the right grind-- a bit larger than espresso-- the coffee is as strong as you want it to be and no grit.  The coffee seems to wash completely out of it, so there is no aftertaste left behind.  WELL DONE!!",20
positive,"This item was purchased a while ago,  For my moms coffee, since she makes her coffee the old fashion way.  It still looks like new. Great purchase.",20
positive,On Samsung refrigerators I found out you need to replace the water filters with original Samsung filters. The knock offs leaked and prevented my icemaker from working properly.,20
positive,"Boy did my face get red, I COULD NOT get it to work I emailed them and they sent me back did you take the brace holding the motor! Well just how dumb do they think I am, ACTUALLY fairly dumb I had not taken it off, in my defense I looked but it is as white as everything else. I told them IF they had wrote remove in black I would have!! I'm old and don't see well so thats my story and I'm sticking with it.<br />I absolutely love this it dries clothes so that in a emergency you could wear them. 5 minutes and it gets a lot of dingy water out of your clothes, this is 3 day's anything goes wrong ""I'LL BE BACK""..",20
positive,"I got this for my Fleetwood Bounder RV that I‚Äôm living in since I sold my house. I got it in December. So there are several things about this machine that I‚Äôve learned.  The main thing is that it works well when the load is very small. Like I‚Äôll run 2 pr jeans together which take about 20 more minutes of drying time after the cycle. Any more in the drum and everything is too wrinkled to wear. I‚Äôll do several tee shirts, undies and socks together. As long as the drum is less than half full, the tees are not too wrinkled to wear. I have this unit vented BTW. I don‚Äôt think it probably works any better vented than ventless. The vented heat is not even forceful enough to open the flap on the outside vent.  And my vent hose is less than a couple feet.  I have to keep that propped open. I don‚Äôt think that is working properly. I made several attempts to speak with someone at the company with no luck and no return call to my many messages. Like others, I agree their service sucks and is at the complete opposite end of the spectrum from Amazon‚Äôs. So I just have to use this machine as is. Sometimes I smell burned hair smells when I open the door during a dry cycle. That can‚Äôt be good. I‚Äôll also do a queen sheet at a time, like do the flat sheet, then do the fitted and cases together. I think if this vented better, it would take more clothes per load.  I guess I‚Äôm grateful to have it. I have lots of dog beds and my duvet covers that all have to go to the laundry mat, so it‚Äôs not like this machine keeps me out of the mat. But I can run my favorite jeans and tees whenever I need them which is great. Now my routine is to do dog beds and throws at the mat and then sheets and clothes here in this. I would rate this 4 stars if the company would answer their phone. I can‚Äôt even get a text from themü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è<br /><br />11/28/22 Edit - I very quickly received a communication from the seller after I posted my review to try to resolve any problems. They have been extremely responsive by txt messaging. Recently, my machine stopped drying and threw a code on the display. I texted them about it and they immediately shipped parts directly to me and set up for a local repairman to come out. He contacted me the day after the parts got here and came out that same day!!  He got my machine up and running again, no fuss, no muss. I have to commend them on their customer service now!!",20
positive,"Ordered these filters after my husband complained of a few grounds in his brewed coffee.  I like that these are unbleached, as everything goes in the compost pile.  We did find that the lid on the pod needs to be pressed all around the edge to close.  It does not just snap shut.  Very happy with these filters, and have shared them with family members.  On our 2nd box, and will continue to order in the future.",20
negative,"It's terrible,  the glue that holds the filter material to the frame didn't hold.  So every time I take the receptacle to fill with water the filter falls out!  It's all soppy wet.  I can barely get it to stay in the frame!!",20
positive,Get some high temperature stick and seal or e600 adhesive with a high temperature rating. Once you have that you're good to go.,20

negative,"I live in a townhome and the temperature between the top floor and bottom floor are very significant. I was hoping to use these for upstairs so that it wouldn't get so hot upstairs and kick the furnace off. The idea is great however the magnet is not strong enough. The cover didn't stick at all to the vent. We ended up using collar stay magnets to keep the corners down. Since we added those the vent covers work great.<br /><br />By itself, the magnet is not strong enough to stick to the vent.",20

positive,"I usually make myself 1 to 2, sometimes 3  Lattes a day with my Nesspresso, that is over 70 a month.  I thought about trying to make my own by cutting own aluminum foil myself and folding over sides.  I decided to give the KreAid a try.<br />I am impressed,  the results are identical to my Nespresso pods with just a light difference  in taste (after all, I am using a different coffee). After the first 2 with the KreAid foils I decided to try my own by cutting out aluminum foil.  that took a lot longer and the results were not near as good.<br />It had the same amount of frouth of the esspresso as the nesspresso pods.<br />As a bonus it will be easier to get the grounds out to use for my garden and grape vines. I will be bying more foils from KreAid when I have used the 100 that came with this set.<br />Update:  it takes me bout an hour to empty and reload 16 pods.  I can get about 30 double expresso pods from a half pound of ground espresso.<br />for best results get the foil lid squarly on the pod so that the edge can go down the edge all the way around. I then take the opposite end of the brush and go around the inside of the pod.  if you get a good seal it seems that the nespresso gets more water out of the pad making it easier to clean out next time.",20
positive,Loved everything g about it.,20
positive,"Brought to use at church when we have events, makes ice quickly, works great.  As long as you don't need 5 to 10 pounds of ice right away this is just great.  Small enough to sit on the counter, does not make a lot of noise.  We are pleased with the product",20

positive,"It is necessary to buy an ice maker in this hot and long summer. Everybody tries to keep social distance to other people and stays home as possible as they can. We stopped to refill our water tank and ice at the water station outside instead of buying a water filter and ice maker.  This machine has been doing so good since we bought two months ago especially for my birthday party.<br />First of all, pull some water in the tank, press the clean button. It costs around three or four minutes. Set up a big bowl under the machine to take out all the dirty water and open the little lid.<br />Secondly, refill as more as drinking water and press the big ice machine and start button.  It makes around 10 ice cubes in 10 minutes. If the water is not enough to make ice, it will stop working automatically and make a warning alarm.  The first round always came small ice cubes even you press the big cubes button.  Normally I choose the small ice cube to make a dessert or any milkshake drinks and pick big ice cube if we leave the machine outside. Sometimes we also keep all the ice in the ziplock plastic bag before we go travel. Using the ice scoop or ice basket to take out the ice.<br />In the end, when everything is done, don't forget to take out all the water same as when you cleaning.<br /><br />In the last two months, all the functions of the ice maker were in good condition.

negative,"This is an apples to oranges, not apples to apples substitute item.  This filter seems like a much better bargain than the Kenmore model's pricier version, BUT this filter does NOT filter anything except odor and chlorine as stated on it's own Performance Data Sheet insert. (see attached images) There is no particulate, lead, mercury, cysts, or any of the several other nasties we don't want to drink that the other more expensive filter does offer.  I want the best water possible going into my family.  I do NOT want lead, which is a growing problem in drinking water.  And do not be fooled by the statement of lead free compliance on the side of the box.  That simply means that the filter itself does not contain lead, but DOES NOT mean it offers removal or even reduction of it.  Note that just above that statement, it does state chlorine REDUCTION.  Do you see the difference?  Wish I had before I purchased this item.  We get what we pay for don't we.",20

positive,"I love this little coffee filter. I bought it for backpacking and I just got back from 9 days on the Appalachian Trail.  I brought a little container of grounds and used this to make fresh hot coffee every morning. I ended up making a cup for other people I met in the shelters nearly every morning because it's just so much nicer than instant.  This takes up virtually no space and is really lightweight, so it's absolutely perfect for backpacking or camping. And it makes a good cup of coffee (I poured the hot water over it, and then let it sit for a few minutes for the best taste).  I 100% recommend this! (I was recommending it to everyone on the trail, in fact).",20
positive,Great,20

I have an ice eating problem and after three days of this ice maker it has yet to run out of ice.  Makes nuggets that are great quality, not quite sonic but good. It's worth the 500$ to me because I had to go to gas stations and get cups of ice when my fridge wasnt making enough and it was starting to add up.",20

Bottom was curled a bit the first day, straightened itself by the next day.  Easy to clean.  I wish they made these for the mini fridge. I constantly get compliments on this!",20
positive,"This thing works great. It's definitely a 2 person installation. Comes with a pattern to help with screw location also it has a 5"" vent if you decide to vent out. So it's either the 5"" vent that has to run all the way out your roof or the filter that's NOT included if you want to run that way. It does come with a paper that says you can get a free filter, why not just put it in the box. Anyways they do sell filter separately. Looks good, works good and the led lights are bright. It's also a slim design so that's a good thing too!",20
positive,very good,20
positive,Good,20
positive,Works great for my freezer,20

Also, because you add the amount of coffee you like, you can make a stronger or lighter brew depending on who you are serving!

However, an LG repair man came and said something needed to be replaced so he replaced it. Now the clothes are not just damp, they are WET. The problem is worse than before. What a disappointment. Please do not buy this machine. It's not even worth what they charge to ship it back and restock it. It would be better to buy from your local appliance store and deal with them directly.",20

positive,I got this for my RV. It is compact but does take up quite a bit of counter space so we have to store it underneath when not using it. But since I got it I have been so happy not to have to hand wash dishes anymore!! It cleans perfectly! Super simple to set up as well.,20
positive,"The home we purchased three years ago came with an ancient single wall oven and a built-in microwave, leaving us with few options to upgrade to the double oven of my dreams. The GE Profile PT9200SLSS seemed like a great compromise - a double oven in the space of a single. Although we couldn't find a floor model anywhere, we decided to buy it after reading the great reviews for this model and the previous version.<br /><br />So far I have been thrilled with its features and performance. The top oven preheats very quickly and is perfect for many of the items I bake - pork chops, cookies, biscuits, etc. We've enjoyed the pizza settings on the upper oven and convection bake on the lower oven. I've slow cooked roasts in the lower oven that are amazingly tender and delicious. The whole chicken I roasted on the convection setting with the probe was cooked perfectly.<br /><br />The biggest question we and many others have had is whether the Thanksgiving turkey will fit inside. The 19 pound bird we have does not fit in my Calaphon roasting pan with V-rack, but as you can see from the attached picture, the turkey does fit (with room to spare) using a disposable aluminum roasting pan. We have a smaller turkey - 13 pounds - that fits in the roasting pan on that V-rack nicely.<br /><br />There are a few cons to the oven, mostly that the rack in the top oven does not come out far without hitting the door, so getting dishes in and out can be a bit tricky compared to a full-size oven. This is a minor quibble, and certainly doesn't outweigh the incredible convenience of having two ovens. I am so thrilled to be able to roast a turkey and bake my pies, rolls, and other holiday side dishes. The only other con is that modern ovens are smaller than old ovens, so we had to have a filler strip custom made to cover the gap in our cabinet. However, we would have had that problem with any new oven.<br /><br />For anyone who wants the versatility of a double oven without having to do a kitchen remodel, I can't recommend this oven enough.",20
positive,Fits and works well and so much more affordable than the ones from the GE manufacturer. Will buy the 2-pack next time.,20
negative,As they say You Get What You Pay For<br />I contacted the company because you couldn‚Äôt set the clock to a 12 house ur clock AM/PM and the next batch it could They sent out items they knew didn‚Äôt work correctly,20

negative,They work ok but do not last long. They do save money by not having to purchase K-Cups,20
positive,"First, these rubber feet smell terrible - like a million freshly made tires. The chemical smell from these can be noxious. I had to soak them in a bath of detergent to get them to a point that could be used. The trade off is, however, a pretty good cushion that reduce most of the noise from my vibrating wash machine. They are also a pain to get in the right place unless you are super human and can lift your washing machine right over the correctly placed feet. I had to McGyver some double sided tape to stick them on the washing machine feet and then slowly push the machine back into its position. Do they work to reduce noise? Yes, but it smells terrible and takes a lot to figure how to lift and place these underneath your washing machine.",20

positive,Excellent product. Works just as advertised,20
positive,"I don't have a filter in my house other than the one in my fridge.  I use bottled water (5 gal refillable, I'm not filling the landfill with plastic) primarily because I don't like the taste of the water in my house.

positive,This belt was a perfect fit for my dryer. Much heavier duty then the OEM belt.,20
positive,"It basically just spins the clothes around for 5 minutes and then that‚Äôs it lol. Doesn‚Äôt dry anything at all not worth trying, and reasonably only fits small items of clothing, like one pair of jeans won‚Äôt fit in here. Mainly use this for baby clothes washing as it helps that I can just toss in when dirty and hang dry and it‚Äôs good again. I use to have to stack up the dirty laundry and do it all at the end of the week and it would get tedious but this way is much faster and feels like less work :)",20

positive,Our refrigerator does not produce enough ice for our family of 5 and purchased this ice maker to avoid having to buy extra bags of ice. It fits on the counter without taking up too much room and makes 9 large cubes every 8 minutes. Our overflow ice tray is always full now!! The whole family is enjoying it!<br /><br />The first one I ordered from a different site didn't work but that may be because I did not fully read the directions. You do need to let the unit sit for at least two hours before you begin to use it.,20
negative,"product doesn't seal in my refrigerator. Water will leak into the fridge and cause a mess to get it out. I bought a two pack, so I thought I would try the 2nd one in case i just got a dud.

negative,It is very flimsy and cheaply made. I don't believe how flimsy it was and don't expect to get 6in pipe no this is comes with sheet of metal and you have to fold it and good luck to make it fit and the cover made from cheap plastic. I wonder why there is a lot of them on sale that are used it's because there is so many return and I'm sure everyone agrees with me so save yourself time and get something more durable trust me because I will not buy this from the dollar store and it's not worth $1,20
positive,"Perfect for the office. Quiet. No vibration. Plenty cold. Looks great. Can't believe I got it for $35.  I will never use the heat function. Also it comes with a car cigarette adapter power cord, could be great for road trips.",20
positive,"I don't know why, but once every so often we give the stove top a good cleaning. Except I can never soak or scrub or sandblast the drip catchers must better than when I started.

positive,Easy install. Great value for little money,20
positive,"These cups, with the inexpensive little filters and device for filling the cups sold through Amazon, are my answer to how to get a really good cup of coffee with a Keurig-type machine.  I take 5 minutes to put filters in each 6 of these, (I have 2 sets), fill with coffee of my choice, and load the K-cup tray, so when I want a cup of coffee this is just as fast as with the manufactured cups, and you drink much better coffee and, oh yes, for a much cheaper price. You can use these without the filters, but the filters make it easy to dump the used coffee, and in a spare 5 minutes, refill them.  ( I have 2 sets of these, so I usually have a tray filled.)  I also much prefer loose tea to tea bags, and these little cups with filters make a fast great cup of tea fast even though the leaves are in contact with the water for a short time, which I think demonstrates how much stronger good loose tea is than the stuff they pack in t-bags.",20

positive,This part was the exact replacement piece for my GE washing machine. I was a bit hesitant because there are so many variations of this type of part and my machine was purchased in 2007. This was an original part from the GE manufacturer. Great price and arrived in just a few days. Happy camper!,20
positive,"My daughter's dryer is in the basement and has a long exhaust hose. Won't  be a problem if she kept the hose clean. As it is, the vent gets blocked, the dryer gets hot and blows a fuse about every 6 months.

negative,"First time posting a review, but I felt this deserved one.<br /><br />I have a Samsung RF4287HARS french door fridge, for which this filter is supposed to be a suitable replacement.  Upon receiving the filter, I installed it per the instructions, and my fridge made a loud groaning noise.  This noise eventually stopped, but clearly was not normal. When trying to dispense water, I would get a little water at first, but it very quickly slowed to a trickle and then stopped.  The dreaded groaning noise would also come back on occasion while trying to dispense water.  Normal flow (with no filter) is 6 ounces in 10 seconds.  With this filter, I was lucky to get 2 ounces in the 30ish seconds it takes before the automatic kill switch kicks in.<br /><br />I've purchased this ""Samsung"" filter, as well as several generic brands, and all of them have acted in a similar fashion.  I finally broke down and spent the $50+ for a Samsung filter from a big box store.  In visually comparing the big box filter to the one purchased from Amazon, the differences are subtle, but numerous.<br />- label on big box filter package says ""mineral water""...label on Amazon filter package says ""fresh water"".<br />- center hole in tip of Amazon filter is tiny compared to the hole in tip of big box filter.<br />- structural design of filter between the two o-rings in completely different between the two.<br /><br />I'm an engineer that has worked in product development for 15+ years, and in my opinion the ""genuine Samsung"" filter I purchased from Amazon is either a knockoff, or an older Samsung design that they have since revised/eliminated.  Keep in mind that neither the Amazon filter nor the new filter from the big box store look like my previous filter (which still works just fine), so clearly Samsung is doing design updates to these filters for some reason or another (my guess is cost reduction).<br /><br />Bottom line, buy this filter at your own risk.  It was completely useless in my fridge and it's being returned to Amazon for a refund.<br /><br />Update: After carefully inspecting the packaging for both filters, there are several differences.<br />Amazon filter - Manufactured for Samsung Electronics by 3M Purification (Mexico), graphic on left side panel is misplaced and overruns text on the package, capacity listed as 1136L/300G<br />Big box filter - Manufactured for Samsung Electronics by Microfilter Co., LTD (Korea), graphic appears properly centered, capacity listed as 1150L/300G.<br /><br />Both filters have the exact same EAN number and UPC code.",20

I liked it so well that I just bought a second one.<br /><br />I use it to make a single cup (put filter over actual cup as a single serve pour-over), as the primary filter for my Pour-over carafe, and in my old-school drip-coffee machine.  It is very easy to clean and the double layered mesh filter is so fine that only very, very, very fine coffee comes through and quickly settles to the bottom where it is very easy to rinse out later.  I usually never drink the last bit of coffee anyway so this is no burden.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FILTER!",20

This review is for the LG LFX25991ST & includes a BACK to BACK comparison with the Samsung counter depth side by side model RSG257AARS/XAA.<br /><br />PROS<br /><br />High cubic foot capacity among the 36"" wide french door, counter depth models.<br />Looks good, nice sliding action on the drawers, nice lighting.<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />Known defect in defrost cycle, this is VERY important; all modern frost free 'fridges enter a defrost cycle to rid itself of frost / ice.<br />Ice is accumulating on the back panel of the freezer, near the evaporator coil & fan.<br />They (LG) tried to engineer a fix but it's only partially effective, they will replace the main circuit board, the new one will have a LONGER defrost cycle (it will now use more energy than what your yellow energyguide sticker said) & change out that back panel which includes two fan motors (one is for the ice maker).<br /><br />Even though our house is always between 30-50% RH ice still accumulates.<br /><br />The compressor has started vibrating, causing bottles & misc items within the fridge to rattle.<br /><br />The leveling system is poor & contributes to make the fridge unnecessarily wobbly when the doors are opened & closed, I made wood shims to help but it doesn't eliminate the wobbles, no matter the surface - I compared on concrete & my kitchen's wood floor. It really gives a flimsy feel for an otherwise nice looking fridge.<br /><br />Controlling proper temps & humidity in the fresh vegetable drawers has been very poor without blocking off cold air ducts.<br /><br />French door design is in vogue but it has a lot going against it...think about this compared to a side-by-side...<br /><br />* You remove the entire contents of your freezer whenever you open it. Hope you don't plan to have that 'fridge in your retirement years. It also exposes all the freezer contents to outside air, moisture in the air quickly turns to frost on your contents & drawer. It requires more effort to find things in the freezer which tend to be buried like a chest & you are in a hunched over position looking for them.<br /><br />* The freezer drawer sliders are more complex than a simple hinged door, they carry a lot of weight & break much more frequently. Simply pulling from the side of the pull handle (asymmetrical force) instead of the center can cause the drawer to go off kilter & make trouble.<br /><br />* There's more gasket surfaces meaning more areas that can leak or for condensate & mold to form on, plus a cheesy center partition that can develop condensation (because it's not heated) & is susceptible to failure.<br /><br />* In order to have ice in the door the ice maker is in the refrigerator section so it's not uncommon for ice to partially melt & clump together causing dispenser jams. A separate ice maker fan forces freezer air via ducts to the ice maker - not the best engineering to go about making & delivering ice - more stuff to go wrong. The SBS actually has the ice & ice maker in the freezer, BRILLIANT!<br /><br />* MANY times it is necessary to open BOTH doors to get something out when it used to be only one with a SBS. Organization is not that good in these.<br /><br />Three service calls & LG has agreed to replace - our point of purchase is getting a full credit from LG & we can now pick another brand/model from them - we are going back to a SBS. The irony is we're as happy to get away from this fridge as we were when we got it! :^)<br /><br />UPDATE<br /><br />We've only had the new replacement, a 24.5 cubic foot Samsung SBS model RSG257AARS/XAA for a few days so this is only an early impression but we do like it MUCH better.<br /><br />Now this is IMPORTANT & something other reviewers CAN""T comment on...We've had BOTH fridges loaded with the same groceries BACK to BACK & the difference is HUGE...<br /><br />PROS<br /><br />MUCH BETTER use of space, we transferred everything out of the 3/4 full LG, put it in the Samsung & it was AMAZINGLY less full AND better organized. Plus, enough room for all the condiments AND a gallon of milk in the door (not so with the LG). Space is a BIG deal when considering a counter depth fridge, we would have never believed it without owning both but the Samsung side by side EXCELS IN SPADES over the LG FD!<br /><br />Everything is easier to ACCESS, the difference is not slight, we are happy to ditch the ""French door"" style, ooo-la-la, good rid-dens.<br /><br />Exterior door display is MUCH easier on the eyes at night.<br /><br />Two out of three people say it looks better, the third (me) is undecided.<br /><br />Can place it more flush against the back wall, per the mfrs spec, this is partly due to how it draws condenser air, the Samsung draws air from the front & the side ensuring that heated condenser air isn't recirculated, the LG draws & discharges condenser air from the back, so you will definitely get recirculated condenser air if you're placing against a wall especially so in an alcove. Samsung includes a flat angled type wall plug on the power cord so you push it back further if your receptacle is behind the fridge.<br /><br />Quieter - vibrates & is noisy at initial start (warm box) but completely acceptable when temps are at normal operation. Ice dropping into bin (especially an empty bin) during the harvest cycle is somewhat loud but infrequent & really a non-issue.<br /><br />Doors can open wider so be careful not to open them into nearby items like pantry doors or an open dishwasher.<br /><br />Costs less.<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />Leveling system is no better, just two leveling feet in the front, fridge wobbles a bit but not as bad as the LG.<br /><br />Lighting is not as bright as the LG since food items tend to block a lot of it, lighting does ramp up on this one.<br /><br />Exterior fit & finish is good but the LG has the edge there.<br /><br />For those with pets, periodically accessing & cleaning the condenser coil on any fridge is a must, this one is more difficult to complete that task than the LG.<br /><br />A lot of people complain about the drawers not opening far enough but they DO open ANOTHER increment if you open the doors all the way, in that case they open plenty. Limiting how wide they open for normal use helps prevent stress & potential for breakage. We are totally OK with this design. The drawer rollers aren't as smooth as the LG.<br /><br />I hope this helps :^)<br /><br />7-6-14 UPDATE: Still happy to have ditched the LG for the Sammy CD SBS.",20

positive,"I had dumbly placed the original piece to my Keurig in the dishwasher to which it fell through the grates and melted to the bottom of the dishwasher. Thankfully, my dishwasher is okay, but the piece was destroyed. I turned to Amazon for a replacement and found this product. It works perfectly with my Keurig and I have had no problems for a few months now. So glad I didn't have to buy a whole new Keurig, and could just settle with a replacement piece. Highly recommend.",20
positive,Is he on and off part replacement works great,20
positive,Cheaper than LG filters and so far fits and works,20
positive,"This was used to get my mini refrigerator off the carpeted floor.  This also helped out considerably by adding a few inches, making it easier to get things out.  A must-have.",20
positive,Thank you for this third party to produce this device for use on old equipment.  I hope they continue to do this service. The device worked as it should with the price tag cheaper than 4 time at local part shop<br /><br />Thanks.,20
positive,"The size is slightly bigger so when I push down the lever, I have to apply higher force. I was initially worried if this is going to break something but so far so good. That said, this pod produces the best Crema among the 2 different reusable pods i have tried. Only thing I wish is it had a reusable lid instead of peal and stick ones. Also I wish it is not this outrageously expensive!",20
positive,Easy to install and works as it should. Just make sure you have the proper size for your Humidifier.,20
positive,"I was hesitant that this filter wouldn't work. It's perfect, no need to spend more for brand name. Will buy again.",20

negative,Was missing a fitting so luckily I had one in shop,20
negative,Not exact enough measurements...ended up being wrong size even though #s matched my search,20
positive,"Works wonderfully,  We love them so much we are going to order more.  They save so much in money if you prefer Starbucks, than buying the prepacked pods.  Love my keurig, love this.  Best to order enough so that you only have to clean them out all at once, one time per day.",20
positive,"The thermometer does what it should well and comes with clear double sided sticky pads. There is nothing preventing the battery from discharging while it's been in warehouse for who knows how long. So yes, the battery died within a few weeks. The display dims out as the battery is dying. Buy a replacement pack in anticipation and factor that into the total cost. Think I got a 4 pack for around $5. Annoying, but whatever.",20

positive,its a filter,20
negative,"Will not stay in place, curl up at the edges and not enough magnetic strength.",20
positive,"I bought this in December 2021 and use it at least an hour a day. In Aug 2022 it stated performing poorly. I tried cleaning, ect buy no luck. they asked for a receipt and a short video of it not working right. A few days later I had a brand new one at no additional cost. AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE ¬°!",20
positive,Super easy to install!,20
positive,good product to keep rental house  stove top burner pans clean,20

negative,Yes,20
positive,Love it.... matches all my other apple stuff,20
positive,"These are just what we needed, serve their purpose without looking cheap or tacky, and are exactly as described and pictured.  We ordered and received the long version.  The only reason for just four stars is the price.  That said, I'd order them again if needed.",20

negative,"I own a Maytag Refrigerator, I bought these filters to replace my old one. I removed the old one and hooked up the new Filter, and that's when it began a Loud Chattering annoying noise, it stopped when the filter was fill of water, but when I tried to get water again the noise began again. Needless to say if you are buying these filters to replace a Maytag filter good luck.",20
negative,Only one of three held up longer than a week or two,20
negative,I was very excited when I opened the package.  Three of the four fit the burners perfectly.  The fourth was warped or somehow twisted so would not lay flat on the burner.  Put a heavy pot on it hoping it would flattened it but no luck.  In order to keep it down I have to keep the pot on it at all times.  The colors are bright and they are very easy to clean.,20
positive,Top of the line works great. A bit hard to install with vented. Bulbs not include!,20
positive,Great filters,20
negative,"This product did not fit my Kenmore range, even thought its said it would in the description.  They were far too small.",20
negative,These melted after several uses and we had to use a screwdriver to break them off! I would not recommend these to my worst enemy. Will not purchase again.,20
positive,Seems to be doing a better job of filtering white particles from ice cubes.,20
positive,Got this for a vent for portable a/c unit and works fine,20
positive,Great filter. I use it daily. Saves alot of money on coffee.,20
positive,Perfect,20
positive,"great product, looked up a video on how to install it and it was on within 5mins. definitely worth it specially since the appliance company's where charging $65 just for the part itself.",20
positive,well received,20
positive,Came quickly and worked exactly as it should.<br />Thank you.,20
negative,Ended up having to tape it to the wall vent in a dorm room because it would not magnetize to the vent.,20
positive,Exactly what I needed,20
positive,Easy and fast! Just what you would expect. Simple ordering process and it was delivered right on time. Product came exactly as advertised. Very pleased!,20
negative,Love the ice but get a vapor lock or something it screams and I always have to turn it off and on,20
positive,I would have given 5 stars but it was missing one of the clips. Luckily it didn't affect its ability to stay in place.,20
negative,Just received part a few minutes ago. Part of the plastic is broken which is very disappointing considering we need this part for our washer to work. Now I have to wait for a replacement that will take another few days to get here,20
positive,Works great but filters don't last long. Gets costly.,20
positive,"I wish I would have bought these sooner.  Plugs right in and lines right up. Wham these eventually go bad, as all burners do, I will buy the exact same ones.",20
negative,broke soon after. I bought about 3 in total. now I have no icemaker to use as this is no good,20
positive,Perfect replacement Maytag Atlantis dryer. I think the screen material seems better than the original.,20
positive,"Finally, we have ICE again. Super easy to install.",20
positive,"To all those having overflow problems:  I called Bunn about this and they sent me at no charge a replacement piece ( shower head?) that they<br />recommend because it causes the water to flow a bit slower, thus eliminating the overflow !  it really works.  Call Bunn and ask.  I used to make only a half pot at a time because of this problem, like so many reviewers , but this solved the problem.  Bunn was very understanding and shipped this piece out right away.  Try it.",20
positive,"The hood arrived without damage, although there were some loose parts inside (easily fixed).  It works fine, looks good, the noise is moderate, and the lights are just about bright enough.  However: the installation manual is so generic that it is completely inadequate.  It doesn't even mention key steps (like installing the damper) so one has to guess.  Under cabinet installation says to attach the hood to the wall, instead to the underside of a cabinet.  There are no drawings showing dimensions -- everything has to be measured on the hood and mounting location prepared accordingly.  I've never seen a product with installation instructions as useless as these.  Fortunately, the process isn't that hard to figure out without instructions.",20
negative,Advertised as general replacement parts for several specific brands of gas dryers.  None of these fit as advertised.,20
positive,Was the right part for our oven and it is working excellent!,20
negative,Dryer worked for a little over a month and one of these have already gone bad. Will spend more money for quality products this time.,20

positive,"My dryer works once again. Delighted with the replacement catch.  Easy to install, no tools needed.",20
positive,Excellent product !!! I used it for replacement of the original one which was broken.,20
positive,Love this fridge.  Purchased for our Summer cabin.  It is perfect and fits my retro design,20
positive,Very nice product. Works as described. I have no complaints. It was a Christmas present to the family. We are enjoying it immensely.,20
positive,"I use this filter.  I find it better than using a muslin bag or a french press.  I love using the Mason jars because it's glass not plastic.  I can brew in the Fridge or on the counter.  It's a little difficult to clean but other than that I love this product.  I find that if I leave the coffee in the cylinder and put it in the sink, waiting for the coffee to dry then dump it out and run water on it upside down it cleans out okay.  I love cold brew.  I buy my own mason jars.  I'm setting up my brother for christmas.  He only drinks Ice coffee and he was the one who introduced me to cold brew.  Best brewing process I've found so far.  Quick, Simple, Cheap!!!!AAA++++",20
negative,"Fits tight, and works. I ordered a GE brand, and I received an after market instead.<br /><br />Update 10/30/2021<br />Last for 23 months",20
positive,Works great. Very happy not to have to trash a new disposable filter every time.,20
positive,It fit in the dryer perfectly.,20
positive,Works great,20
positive,"I read a lot of reviews before settling on this item, with many comments from coffee gourmets who are quite choosy about their beans. I offer two thoughts: make sure you get a fairly powdery grind. I recommend getting one of the commercially available K-cups and look at the dry ground beans and try to match that. (However, when I went to a good coffee place, they already had a pre-set for reusable K-cup users); and wash it thoroughly each time. I do not use a filter (my goal was less environmental impact) and the little holes are very good filters.",20
positive,So much better to buy here rather than directly with Sears.  Sears is super expensive for replacement parts!  It shipped quickly and arrived as expected.,20
positive,This is a perfect fit for running a line from washing machine hose bib to a refrigirator water line. This is all I need instead of using 2 adapters from 3/4 to 1/2 and then 1/2 to 3/8 like someone recommented.,20
positive,Fit perfectly.  No problem with installing.  Did buy a replacement before but lasted not as long as I expected.  Hope this one last longer.,20
positive,Looks identical to GE at half the price. A lot of useful communication from the company. Very pleasant experience overall.,20
positive,"Exactly what we needed, delivered in  a timely fashion.",20
negative,Do not buy these pods!  They do not fit my Kurig Slim and they are not retrnable!,20
positive,I needed a knob; this was the right one!  Perfect!,20
positive,This was good value and quality.  Upgraded wiring harness was included.  This made the installation take a little more time but still not very difficult after reviewing online videos.  Ice maker worked great after installation.,20
positive,"Followed the YouTube video, got it installed, oven came on, no more F11 code",20
negative,"This product fits the Nespresso Vertuo line - but becomes suctioned in and near impossible to get out. We‚Äôve tried everything- doesn‚Äôt matter how long you let it cool down,  it‚Äôs stuck. We were gentle, but the last time we tried maneuvering the pod out of the machine, it ended up pulling the spring base out of the machine itself. Can‚Äôt fix it. Complete garbage- which is exactly where it‚Äôs going.",20
positive,Seals really well. I do a lot of bundling of items and putting in a polly bag and seal. This was perfect - thank you,20
positive,"What can I say. Water tastes great, half the price of the kenmore replacement and I would recommend and have.",20
positive,Washing machine wasn't draining.  This was the part needed to fix.  Installation wasn't too bad.  I filmed a video and it will be up on Youtube under the WJ Handy Dad channel.,20
positive,Will buy again.,20
positive,Been using these for years  and will continue to.,20

positive,Worth the money. Stylish,20
positive,Good price on time fits,20
positive,"These filters fit perfectly, perform their intended purpose and are a lot less costly than similar items.",20
positive,Nice size and easy to read.  The temperature and humidity readings on this gauge are as accurate as the readings on my other gauges which are made by three different manufacturers.  The humidity numerals on this gauge are larger than the temperature numerals which is a bit confusing since it's  the other way around on all my other gauges.,20
negative,"Despite the description, these do not work in my Keurig 2.0. Ordered another manufacturer that states they work with a 2.0, will update review if I find some that work!",20
negative,This this piece of crap was 25 bucks?  I want my money back. It didn't work right out of the box. NO CONTINUITY!  It's pretty difficult to fix a broken oven when the replacement parts arrive broken.  Disgusted to say the least.,20
positive,Fit perfectly on my Kenmore,20
positive,"Awesome product, great replacement for my whirlpool fridge",20
positive,like,20
negative,Extremely disappointed in this product. Mine literally burned on the first day I used it on the stove! Definitely would NOT buy again!,20
positive,"works great! took a few pours to clean it out, but after that - it's been good!",20
negative,I ordered this fridge 8 months ago. The door suddenly started making a super loud noise which sounds like a screaming crying dog.. The door sometimes does not stay shut. I'm now having to pout something in front of the door so it stay shut otherwise it will leak water all over my wood floors. I'm going to have to replace this eventually. Everyone in my entire house of 4000 sq ft. can hear me opening the fridge door from my office. I have to make sure my office door is closed in the early hours otherwise I will wake up my entire neighborhood due to the sceaming crying hound dog door!!!,20
positive,"The unit was shipped promptly and arrived in good shape.  Like others have said, this is an aftermarket replacement icemaker.  As long as you've kept you're old hardware, it installs easily and most importantly, it works!",20
positive,"Delivery was on time and price was very fair.  It made sense to order the complete switch assembly since the individual switches are so expensive on their own.<br />My case:  GE PVM1790SR1SS combo Microwave / Convection Oven where the timer would count down when we attempted to cook, but no fan and no microwaves.  We got this oven at the beginning of 2013 and already had to replace one of the switches a few years back (maybe around 2016 or so).  What happens often is that people will open the door near the end of the cooking time instead of letting the cycle finish on its own.  But doing that causes those door interlock switches to interrupt the power on their own and this hastens their wear significantly because of the large current that is stopped (when the cooking has stopped automatically at the end of the set time and the door is then opened there is very little power to be interrupted).<br />Replacement is not too bad:  I did not have to remove the Microwave, only the top horizontal plastic cover and the Control Panel.  I took photos along the way so I could be confident of the wires/cables/connectors I unplugged so they could get mated and routed back as they belong.  With some patience and fiddling you can remove the screws and unplug the switch assembly and slide the new one in place.  There are some good YouTube videos that go through this procedure.  One that I watched was:<br />https://youtu.be/YYyl8WaFldY<br />This was not for the exact same Microwave, but the idea is very similar for our oven.<br />Good luck!",20

positive,Fit perfect & easy to install,20
positive,I love everything about this coffee pot.  I've  had a Cuisinart single serve pot for over 5 years.  It finally quit working so I replaced it with this one. I like this one better than the old one I had.  I purchased a Kuerig but didn't like it so returned it to the store I purchased it from than ordered this one.,20
negative,This valve failed in a matter of weeks and I had to have it replaced again.,20
positive,"These suck, but it's not the reseller's fault. I imagine this one will eventually break like the original did, but at least it didn't cost me a fortune.<br /><br />Description was accurate and I'm happy not to have to deal with a broken drawer any longer.",20
negative,"The factory product would have cost me 4X as much. After two weeks of constant use, still working well. Nothing easy about installing because of tight quarters, but YouTube saved time and effort.<br /><br />UPDATE: Buy 3 and replace every 4 months. Element burns out about 4 months from installation",20

negative,"Great ice maker, everything I wanted at a fair price.  Using it to supplement my ice supply, works great and easy to use.<br /><br />Well, I thought so at the time.  The first machine started leaking and stopped making ice about 9 months after my purchase.  After many emails, they gave me a discount on a second machine (they did not replace it for free).  Well, the second machine developed the same problem about 6 months after I received it.  This time, Euhomy said that they will send me a replacement part and instructions on how to take apart my ice maker to install the part.  FYI, I have a cracked water tube.  I wish I would have purchased something different.  Not worth the hassle!",20

positive,"We have a Whirlpool gas double oven range. It has access to the igniter wiring connector only from the back of the range, not from the front. This requires moving the stove out far enought to get behind, which requires removal of the flexible gas line. This line is considered single use only, and should be replaced when reconnecting, making this a more complicated and expensive install. This igniter lets you splice the wiring from the front, using ceramic wire nuts, by cutting the wires at the old igniter, and attaching the wires that way. Took probably 15 minutes to install this way.",20
