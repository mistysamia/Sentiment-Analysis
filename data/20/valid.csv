positive,"I own a appliance repair company and usually only use factory oem parts.  I had a customer who was selling their home and the fridge was staying there.  The factory part was $160 my cost and these were under $100, so I gave them the cheap option.  I installed these and they didn’t have any issues while they still owned the fridge.  Will offer these again.",20
positive,Attached to iron gate that pulled away from fence post. Works great. Not too conspicuous,20
positive,This product is an exact fit and shipping was fast,20
positive,ARE INEXPENSIVE AND WORK WELL,20
positive,"Not bad for the price. Kind of loose fit with the catch pawls, but it should last a few years.",20
positive,When using this SS Dripper grind your coffee a little to the course side.  Fine grinds will allow seepage through the mesh into your coffee.  Other than this adjustment to my grinding product works extremely well.,20
positive,"Arrived with one part damaged, great customer service replaced part right away. had a little trouble with installation as holes did not line up perfectly but easy to fix. after installation product works as new. Would use this vendor again.",20
negative,"This Inlet Valve I purchased in 2014 lasted less than 3 years.  Failed again, time to replace. Good Price compared to buying at Sears Parts.",20
positive,"Good product, very satisfied.",20
negative,I looked up my part number based on my dishwasher model on whirlpool and then found this replacement part about half cheaper than the whirlpool website. It was very easy to install but unfortunately it melted the bottom of our dishwasher tub and our dishwasher now leaks which created a bigger problem than we originally had.,20
positive,"I was happy to get this delivered so quickly... my husband had cracked the front of ours.  I opened the big box and found the pan suspended by a piece of cut-out cardboard which fit snugly in the box.  (No other type of padding.)  I took it out, and to my dismay, the back corner of the pan was broken off and laying in the bottom of the box.  It would be too bothersome to ship it back, wait for a refund, order another one, wait for it to be shipped, etc. etc., so I am keeping it and using it BROKEN, but for $44 it should have arrived intact.  How about a little more quality control (and bubble wrap) in the shipping department??",20
positive,Well built. Runs a little noisy and seems to be running a lot. It does get cold down to 40 and stays there.,20
positive,Everything we needed to get our dishwasher running! Much better deal then buying from Lowe’s also,20
positive,"Fabricado con plastico BPA de un buen tamaño como dice en la imagen, cumple con lo anunciado",20
positive,"Worked great, fast service.",20
negative,As the title said the 1st one burnt out quickly,20
positive,this is the same part as the $40+ OEM ripoff. don't feed the whirlpool scam. avoid their overpriced replacement part and dont reward designed failure.,20
positive,This is a great product with a great price. Thanks,20
negative,I thought all coffee filters were the same.  These are much thinner than than usual and I end up with coffee grounds in my coffee!  I even use very coarse ground coffee.<br />I will not buy these again.,20
negative,Wrong filter. I needed the Ultra this is not.,20
positive,just what we needed mine was missing off our Bunn fir perfect. Use less coffee now. Great!,20
negative,Never buy again never worked right have a company handle warranty Curtis international. what a joke had to call fill out lots of forms send pictures took over a month and now they want me to mail it to Compton California cost$68.75  DO NOT BUY WARRANTY IS USELESS.,20
positive,Awesome!!  Fit perfectly!!<br />Wish it included instructions but I eventually figured it out.,20
positive,Works great.,20
positive,Fits percolator.,20
positive,as promised,20
positive,Works good in our standard mr coffee machine. Cleans out very easy. Saves money in the long run. Don’t notice a flavor differ Wx from paper filters,20
positive,I needed one big one with three little ones & this was perfect. Now my stove looks beautiful with its new look.,20
positive,We ordered these for our Samsung fridge and they fit and appear to do the job well. Easy to put in and take out and reasonably priced.,20
positive,I have always had a problem inserting these little devices and this one was a breeze!,20
positive,Cheap and convenient,20
positive,Was easy,20
positive,Stove burner cover made messy cooking more fun it's easy to clean and reusable.,20
positive,Works great!,20
positive,works great exact replacement,20
positive,This replaced the oven coil on an old Kenmore unit. I typed the exact part number from the manual and found it on Amazon. The part arrived when they said it would and it works perfectly!,20
positive,Thanks for the perfect fit. My wife was not happy with the wheels falling off. This made me a hero!,20
positive,I have been ordering this brand filter instead of the genuine LG filters and have been very happy.,20
positive,"Standard fuse, got my dishwasher working again, has been installed for several weeks now and running just fine.",20
positive,"Im not too familiar with mini fridges, my only basis was the complaints others have left on other fridges. With that in mind, this fridge with separate doors for freezer and fridge keeps each compartment at the temperature that seems correct. My tv dinners stay hard frozen and the food is cold but not frozen.<br /><br />Noise is minimal but yeah you hear it, I saw somebody complained about that, it doesn't bother me, never had a regular fridge make less noise so I think it's a non issue.<br /><br />The freezer holds about 5-6 TV dinners plus about 5 frozen burritos. The fridge compartment is ok, I don't like the strange can holder in the door nor the other holder it doesn't hold stuff very well otherwise it's okay.<br /><br />Main thing is it keeps what I need at right temps. I didn't take off for the scratch but somebody else would have, It was right on the front door and the door did not have a protective plastic over it while another less important part of the fridge did.",20
positive,I love these because water flows through them easily and they fit perfect in my 10 cup and prevent grounds from winding up in coffee cup due to their little extra height. You won’t look back if you give these a try.,20
positive,"I got this product right before Thanksgiving, My oven was not working till I got it.",20
negative,"I am using this hood now for about 5 years. The hood is solid and powerful. The only, and very annoying, the problem is that the touch buttons started to act up not too long after it was installed. The light goes on/off more or less randomly, and the fan doesn't start if you hit the button (or instead of the fan coming on, the clock is changed) The buttons are pretty much ""random"". Hit them often enough, and it may work (or not). and after a bit, it may increase in speed or decrease. My suspicion is that some grease got into the electronics. I have had the issue with other touch controls in kitchen appliances, but usually, there is a relatively simple way to disassemble them. Not here (at least I haven't found the trick yet). A more mechanical control, vs. the nice looking but not functional touch control would be much better in a rough environment like above a hot stove. The stove is used almost daily.",20
negative,"I can not believe keurig would make such an inferior product! If you fill it up all the way you have crunchy coffee(grinds in coffee). If you only fill half to 3/4 way all you get is flavored hot water! I also even notice clear water coming into my cup as well. Not sure why that is happening. I saw some of the other generic (ie ekobrew, the one made by solo cup) and thought no, better get the name brand and the one that was made for the machine. Now i regret,$16 down the drain. Just purchased the ekobrew and hope it is better!",20
positive,Great product and will purchase again,20
positive,product is exactly what it says. really pumped that i fixed my own dryer in less than an hour! bo ya!,20
positive,The dryer is working better with better flow of air,20
positive,Took time to look for a small yet good size dryer. Plug in anywhere basically without any outlet changes  May take a little longer to dry but does the job.  And quietly,20
positive,sO FAR IT ARRIVED ON  TIME intact. Now we have to use it to see how its working,20
positive,They a perfect.  Just what I have been looking for in the stores for months.  Will order again when I need more,20
positive,"Smaller then the factory size that came with my fridge, but works just as well. Will order a second so my fridge and freezer have matching sized handles",20
positive,This works great. Love being able to use my own coffee,20
positive,These work great and save us quite a bit of money. Also we can now enjoy coffees that don’t offer kcups. They are easy to use and easy to clean. Very happy with my purchase.,20
positive,Easy for install,20
positive,"Easy to install, matched the stainless range exactly what I needed when I had to replace my range and it was just a tad off on the size of the range it was replacing.",20
positive,It’s easier to buy in a larger quantity and for a great price.,20
positive,Saved my washer!  very well priced be sure to watch videos online to how to install if novice,20
positive,Exactly what I needed for my fridge!,20
positive,"I bought a Solofill, but it was too difficult to clean and didn't provide a strong enough cup of coffee.  I decided to try the ekobrew and it delivered!  Seems to hold more coffee, providing a stronger 11oz cup, and is very easy to rinse quickly.",20
negative,"Out of the 6, only 4 of the lids stay closed. A little disappointed cause there’s no way to fix the ones that don’t close.",20
positive,Wonderful deal save me a ton of money not having to buy a new rv fridge,20
positive,don't quite understand why the pilot light clicks on the front right burner only regardless of which burner you turn on.  They all have the little clicker do-hicky on the side but they all &#34;ignite&#34; from that main right front burner.  But all seems to be working good so far.,20
positive,Nice machine so far. Seems like it will hold up well. The only small complaint is that the basket for the ice moves around a bit when ya get the ice out but it doesn't affect the use,20
negative,Only lasted a year. Due to the design of the Samsung dryer install was a lot of work. Ended up buying a new dryer as I don’t want to keep going through this every year.,20
positive,"I love the price of the water filter for my GE fridge, but when I installed the new filter, it did not turn off the red light on the front of my fridge that shows it needs a new filter.  It says to hold the button down for 3 seconds, but that did not clear the red light.  I ran 10 giant glasses of water through the fridge and tried to clear the red light again, all to no avail.  I know the filter is new, so I'm giving it 6 months before I order a new one.  Would like to know if anyone else has had this problem using a compatible water filter.  I had replaced 2 other filters, but had always used the GE brnad.",20
positive,Works like new.,20
positive,Good replacement and easy to install,20
positive,Delivered timely and very easy to install.  Thank you,20
positive,Ordered the knobs since they weren’t covered under warranty. Great deal,20
positive,I had to replace my previous dryer timer since the post crumbled to dust. Hopefully this one is a bit more sturdy. I also replaced the time knob with an OEM knob for $25. That is after previously using a $7 metal reinforced knob that warped quickly and ruined the previous timer post.<br /><br />The timer install takes 5 minutes once you have access to your dryer's back panel.,20
negative,"Reason for the low star rating is that, the craftsmanship is not that great. For the price I expected better. Way better.<br /><br />The fridge looks good at first. Upon a closer inspection. I found the lower grill area a bent, the door hinge was not seated properly, which cause the top part to be indented in. The inside back wall had screws that were loose, the door lock had a screw that was only half in.<br /><br />The fridge function fine so far. Noise level is fine, don't notice it running at all. The temperature control are easy to use. Has blue lighting with 2 or 3 brightness setting.<br /><br />Didn't want to go thru the hassle of scheduling a returning, so I just fix it myself. I don't know if the damage are from shipping or just poor craftsmanship. But I do not recommend this.",20
positive,Loved the fit.,20
positive,Does what is required and intended of this product.,20
positive,Great price. Perfect replacement.,20
positive,"Works perfectly! Condition is new, good quality, “Whirlpool” brand. With Whirlpool,<br />theres a lot of superceded part numbers, product slightly different from original - but still fits and works perfectly! Price is great,<br />saved a lot of money",20
positive,Easy ordering and fast delivery.  The price was great and filter is easy to install.,20
negative,Terrible. These are junk. Don’t waste your money.,20
positive,[[VIDEOID:5b95a1db526d3145ff64514f40db75bc]] Great filter will be purchasing again.,20
positive,Puts the water down the drain and not in my floor.  That's what I like about it.,20
positive,"I am very pleased with the cooler thus far.  Provided hot and cold water at the desired temperature.<br />It is hard to judge where the water will come out without bending over and looking for the spout, which is recessed.  I think the spouts should have been longer.",20
positive,"Fits great, nice and snug to the stove, although I do have to trim the bottom. Got two in the package, which is great because my stove is up against the wall, so I can always use the other one later on. It does NOT slide when cooking or cleaning, and it’s easy to remove and dip in the sink to clean, I wipe it as I use it, then once a week give it a good cleaning in the sink, (I don’t cook every night) 😀",20
positive,Saves time and money reduces laundry pile also I am able to wear a shirt that I got dirty in the same week. Dont have to wait for two weeks . Less to carry to the laundry room. Kitchen linens never run out of fresh clean every day . It is its own hamper.,20
positive,Easy to install.,20
positive,Delevered on time and since then is working perfectly.,20
positive,"My first attempt at fixing the dishwasher was a success. I diagnosed the issue as a 6-4 error using the KitchenAid troubleshooting guide. The water inlet valve failed as it failed to push water into the dishwasher. After replacing that, water would trickle in but not spray. I verified the board did not have a major short in F8 or F9 which led me to believe it was the pump.<br /><br />After watching a Repair Clinic video on this replacement I got the courage to order the part and try to replace it. Start to finish it took about 1.5 hours. Started right up and hasn’t leaked.<br /><br />I had to buy a clamp to secure the pump fitting to the inlet which cost an extra $20. Still beats paying the repair man or a new dishwasher.",20
positive,"For frothing milks, about 1/2 cup (4 oz.) is all you can put in without it overflowing. Good, but small.",20
positive,Item fit perfectly. Exact match. Diagnosed issue was resolved by replacement part.,20
positive,"Seems accurate, more so than other ones I've tried over the years.",20
positive,perfect match for our appliances. very easy to install. great quality,20
positive,Fits ok. Cheap and not gold color.,20
positive,Worked perfect for my fridge,20
positive,"Our washing machine used to shake relentlessly and move all over the laundry room. We came across these and decided to give them a try, what do we have to lose? They are fantastic! It’s so much quieter now that my husband put these on our machine and no more loud shaking noises.",20
positive,Fit as expected worked great,20
positive,This is the water filter required for our refrigerator. It works well and lasts quite awhile before needing to be replaced. The Amazon description was very clear and accurate. The Amazon customer reviews were helpful. It was well packaged and arrived on schedule.,20
negative,"advertised for my dryer ,it is not the correct part.I have to try to sell to someone else cause i would be loosing my money if i returned it",20
positive,Fit perfect. Problem solved.,20
positive,They end up being expensive because you really need to buy two if there are two lights bc they won’t match. They did fit perfectly  perfectly.,20
positive,"Soak, rinse and repeat as needed. These filters seem no different than the branded versions and have a lower cost. Thanks for making my coffee maker happy again K&J. Cheers!",20
positive,It fix's my refrigerator and it filters water..  I win!,20
positive,"Great fit, quality product, no aftertaste and value priced!",20
positive,Quick fix.,20
positive,"I have had to try different grinding a to get the right one for these refillable pods. However, I find it is so worth it if trying to enjoy good coffee and yet save some $$. I am ordering more soon to have a larger number for filling less offen.",20
positive,I ordered the wrong size for my oven but it still works and was very easy to install.,20
positive,Good price and quality,20
positive,I use this every week and love it! Super easy and works great!,20
positive,It came quickly and was exactly what I needed. It was nice to have the thermistors also included. Wasn't exactly easy to put in but that's more Samsung's problem as they don't make it exactly easy to get inside.,20
negative,I didn't like this because it didn't do what I needed it to do.  I have medical problem that I have to wash my compression sleeves and gauntlet every other day.  This machine did what it said but then I had to rinse my items out by hand numerous times to get the soap out.  Then I had to wring them out and that is not good for the items.  This worked like it said it did but it isn't for what I need it for.,20
positive,It was well wrapped when arrived. This egg holder is well made with high quality plastic. it is easy to open the top lid and get the eggs without getting the try out.,20
negative,The stove works fine but the finish is less than one would expect. Oil wipes off the painted knobs and glass cleaner stained the black stovetop,20
positive,"This nugget maker is the perfect addition to our  wet bar area - compact, portable and makes the perfect nuggets.  Highly recommended.",20
positive,Works great with no mess,20
positive,"In the past used to loosen the Frigidaire filter housing by hand, the Frigidaire refrigerator filter housing is located in an awkward spot and this wrench makes it a lot easier to unscrew the housing to be able to change the filters every six months or so.",20
positive,"I was a little unsettled by the 'Amazon Fit' rigamarole which could not confirm the fridge model against this item. I was comparing with an image and data off an OEM Samsung cartridge. The CG image does not show the end of the pack for easy confirmation. I decided to bite the bullet because of Amazon's awesome return policy, which was not needed. I have 3 filters for the price of one Samsung device and that is a win. My city water is routinely clear so I'm paying for filters that don't do much. I feel better now replacing it rather than just resetting the alarm, since the price is reasonable.",20
negative,"I was so looking forward to getting this little coffee brewer and I really wanted to like it. I tried several different ways to get a good cup of coffee out of it but was unsuccessful. The coffee is very smooth; smooth like warm brown water with a hint of coffee flavor. I tried a finer grind and a longer steep time but ultimately went back to my french press. If you like a very mild flavored coffee, this could be the perfect solution for you. It is very clean and easy to use and the coffee is brewed quickly. But as one whose preferred coffee is black Americano, it just isn't flavorful enough for me.",20
positive,"perfect fit, good price",20
positive,"This thing does work, if you take the time to place it in front of the door, after using the washer. That takes only about a second, but getting my wife to do that is taking a little longer.",20
positive,No complaints. It fits.,20
positive,Kenmore elite dishwasher 7 years old started leaking and found diverter seal bad. Ordered these as replacement. They look very similar but once installed they sit a bit higher and are looser than original. Installed and applied small amount of silicone around outside edge of seal. So far no leaks. I think the material they are made of is different than OEM. We'll see how long these last  hopefully I get a couple of years out of them. If they fail before I'll update.,20
positive,The dryer works! Cost $5 to fix it!,20
positive,"Thought would have to replace the racks as tips were rusted, leaving marks on dishes. These work great. Saved lots of money.",20
positive,Excellent quality.,20
positive,The price for this replacement handle was extremely reasonable (much cheaper than a new microwave). There was an instructional video my husband watched and had it installed in no time.,20
negative,This product worked for two days and then tasted like pure baking soda. Both filters. Cheap knock-off that even admits on the box that it doesn’t filter your water of several things you expect it to. Spend the money and buy the real thing.,20
negative,I have only had this product for a couple of weeks and it seems to work for what I need it for. I did notice that if you do wash three or more loads it does start to smell and makes a high pitched noise which I don’t like since I live in an apartment.  I was disappointed in that but I guess I can live with it.  I just try to do laundry while my neighbors are gone which is not always convenient for me. It is light weight and I can move it wherever I need it to be so that is a plus.  Don’t know if I would buy another one from this company.,20
negative,"My Jenn-Air range is from 1985 and these knobs did not fit it. I sent them back to the seller and received a full reimbursement minus the postage I had to pay to return them. Beware...these are for new Jenn-Air ranges, not the old ones like mine.",20
positive,Was concerned that the filter would not work with our old Maytag frig.  No problem! Works well.,20
negative,"If I could rate these negative, I would.  I bought two at $50 each.  The fridge does not recognize them. They are labeled like they should work.  I peeled the RFID off the old one, put it on the new one, and it kinda worked but complained about being expired, then failed. Now I'm out $100.<br />GE is scamming customers.  Don't buy these. I will never buy another GE appliance either. GFY GE",20
positive,It was exactly like original And came the next day. We use dryer everyday so time was important,20
positive,My husband bought this for our kitchen it was very easy to install and we have not had any problems with it.,20
positive,"We always use pour over with an electric kettle as it cuts down on the acid and bitterness.  Yes, it takes more coffee.  The quality and making each cup as you drink it, makes it perfect for anyone.",20
positive,Rellay was clicking. Board seems to have done the trick. Easy install. Delivery was fast. Great price!,20
positive,A+++,20
positive,Didn’t fit our washing machines feet inset to small.,20
positive,Fix me right up I went to take the lid off my washer and like a goober I dropped the lid with the switch wire still attached and that was all she wrote. The new switch seems to be of OEM quality. Been running this now for about 2 months with zero issues.,20
positive,Wall oven,20
positive,Perfect fit,20
positive,Very nice addition to our patio kitchen.,20
positive,I needed to get these belts to fix my fathers washing machine.  The price is great.  They wanted $35 EACH at the local appliance repair shop.  It pays to shop on line !,20
positive,"This is an exact replacement for my Westinghouse dishwasher.  The documentation says it is used on several different models, and perhaps a couple other brands.  The part has a design flaw that means that the plastic buttons that hold the wheels on eventually succumb to the harsh chemicals in the detergent and the heat of drying and erode and then the wheels fall off.  There is no repairing them in the average garage (I tried), so they must be replaced.  This is why you should buy this pack of five, because they will all fail within two to five years, maybe a bit longer.  [I've replaced three so far on my five-year-old dishwasher].  It would be nice if they redesigned this part to last longer like they did with the stops on the arms that hold the upper basket, but alas, you just need to keep a couple of these handy in the garage for their eventual failure.  They are very, very easy to replace when they fail.  Good luck!",20
positive,"So something happened to three of the wheels on our dishwasher and we have no idea where they went, this is a new home for us. It was so beyond easy to locate the wheels on Amazon and we were so pleased when they arrived and were 100% what was advertised. Super easy to put on. Perfect match for the ones that were already on the racks, heavy duty, and a reasonable price. Very pleased. 👍",20
negative,"I thought this would be a good replacement for the Cuisinart coffee filters, but the amount of ingredient in the filter is about 37% less than the coffee filter I am currently using.",20
negative,Wrong size filter. Returned.,20
positive,just what l expected,20
positive,Replaced frig water filter,20
negative,"Item was ordered and received on a timely basis but turned out to be the wrong filter. On the plus side, item was returned and credited accordingly on a faultless basis!",20
positive,Good price I wish the shipping was a little faster but got in 4day not 2days overall good deal,20
negative,Had for less than 2 years and the control board went on it.  Used in a clean home and well taken care of.  The one star is for cleaning well when it worked.  Terribly Disappointed and would never recommend Maytag made by Whirpool.  Customer Service was even worse.,20
positive,"Beautiful and sturdy. I use these pitchers to steam milk (you could use them for other things!) However, not my first choice for latte art.",20
positive,Amazing,20
positive,Just what I was looking for.  Did my own custom installation.,20
positive,It fit my microwave as promissed.<br />Package and delivering was excellent and ontime<br />installation was very simple.<br />I could not be more satisfy,20
positive,My washer broke. The laundrymat was far away and dirty. This little washer washed a lot of clothing for me including sheets and jeans. Do small loads for heavier fabrics. After using it for awhile you figure out how to save on water. Am keeping mine to use for smaller loads and delicates.,20
positive,Was able to reduce the sentiment by 80%.,20
positive,Love coffee,20
positive,Good,20
positive,My Lakefront view is much more comfortable when I change monthly my humidifier’s filter. Easy to do so.,20
positive,We have been using these compactor bags for many years now and love them.  I'm pleased that they are still available.  Delivery was very quick.,20
positive,"It was durable, good for what I needed, but during shipping it was dented, so it was hard to unroll sometimes. Could have been a bit more protected.",20
negative,"I will give this four stars for being an amazing bargain.  However, it will not fit my range.  I have a vintage '60s Tappan Fabulous 400, and the wire loops on mine look nearly identical to those shown in the picture.  The measurements are perfect, but the size of the wire loops on these are too large to fit the plug-ins on my range.  The wire loops on my existing burners are much tighter and a bit smaller.  Too bad.  Last time I replaced a burner, I had to go to a local appliance repair store in a major city and it cost me about $35 to get one.  So, the cost savings are substantial if this one will fit your range.  I would recommend doing some research before buying a burner replacement to make sure.  The one I got in the mail was shipped very quickly and it looks very sturdy, it's just too bad it won't work on mine.  It looks like an excellent product if it will fit your range.",20
positive,Just like original,20
negative,These filters are too thick; they're like folded up pieces of notebook paper. This causes the coffee to slop around the filter rather than going out the bottom like it should. I bought them because they'd ship out quickly. Look for the brown ones that look more like crepe paper - they work better.,20
positive,"Why I gave it a 4 instead of 5.<br />I can go along with all the previuos reviews, it does really organize the freezer, no more digging to the bottom of a pile of frozen foods to find what you think you still have in there.<br />On the minus side, you do give up a bit of intereior space, offset by being able to find things.<br />Our freezer is a Hotpiont 7.2 cuft. The baskets were an inch too wide (16""), I had to shorten the baskets to 15"" to fit in our freezer. It was easy enough to cut a half inch off each side with a hacksaw but really since the baskets expand, why not make them to fit all freezers. One other comment someone made, the baskets should lock into position. PS: We purchased this from Amazon instead of the manufacturer just in case we wanted to return it. Which we don't.",20
positive,Perfect pitcher for steaming milk.,20
positive,Able to get in timely fashion & cost effective,20
positive,"My dryer didn't explode after I installed it, so I guess that's a good thing",20
positive,"I am loving this range top!<br />Beware though, we did measure for 36 inches but it was a tad bigger. Luckily I have a handyman who knows how to cut tile to make it fit.<br />But it looks very nice! Learning the different burners isn’t hard lol but takes some getting used to! We recently updated our kitchen & this was a very nice addition.",20
positive,"My refrigerator's ice maker is broken again, so I decided to get an ice maker instead of fixing my fridge again. The cubes are smaller and thinner which makes them not last as long in your drink, but that doesn't bother me. It's a lot cheaper than fixing my fridge. Note: when you transfer the ice to your freezer, you will need an awl to break up the ice as it will freeze up in one, big clump.",20
positive,They are a perfect fit!  Been using for awhile now. Very happy. Worth every penny!,20
positive,The same as the original but way less money,20
positive,Totally fixed my non working magic chef oven.,20
negative,"I'm not sure what the life span is of a drip pan, but these only lasted my about 2.5 months as a long estimate.  What is worse is I don't cook that often.  My main complaint is that they are rusting.",20
positive,This filter does the job but without the cost.,20
positive,"I bought this for my husband for his birthday, and he loved it. Super easy to use!",20
positive,"Works like it should, although a little flexy",20
positive,Met my expectations.,20
negative,"Little bit Flimsy, Hard to place the appliance on top of it alone because it is not sturdy enough to be place underneath a half lifted appliance, you have to actually lift up the whole thing and place it as  well as possible on top of it.<br />although the length is adjustable but when it gets closer to end of the rod is not strong enough",20
positive,Ordered and received this latch without a hitch. Best price anywhere. I installed it in less than 10 minutes following instructions on you tube video. This particular part includes the handle some do not so you have to use the old one or buy it separately. Make sure you order this exact item if you want easy and complete replacement. I am very satisfied with the quality. Works like a charm.,20
positive,"My fridge had a mesh underneath the water/ice dispenser.  It disappeared, probably hiding out in the company of odd socks that seem to get lost on a regular basis.  Anyway, thought I’d get this to reduce the splashes.<br />I had to trim it to fit the actual tray, but I’m thinking differently.  I think the full size would help reduce the excess water and associated staining.  Luckily this package had two items, so I’ll give the cut down one a try for a while and then switch out for the full size.<br />Recommended,",20
positive,I hadn't priced these at local stores lately but prior checks indicate these were competative.,20
positive,"Apparently, this part is subject to wear on several makes and models, and this replacement part popped right in and functions beautifully. SAVED ME $90 SERVICE CALL!!! Perfect!!!",20
positive,"Worked just as advertised, fit right where it needed to go for the broken spring i had.",20
negative,Get this foe a Christmas gift for my mom it will not even work no matter what I do it will not make ice,20
positive,I really like the sturdy build and clear label. The white color fit the white wall way better than the black one. And it worked perfectly with my new dryer. highly recommended,20
negative,"This water filter was supposed to replace an UKF-8001 filter in my Jenn-Air refrigerator.<br />My old filter was a PUR UKF-8001.<br />Unfortunately, this filter did not connect properly in my refrigerator.  It didn't want to turn far enough to the right to make a connection.<br />It's obvious when it is connected correctly; there is an audible sound.  Never got that for this filter.<br />Had to try one from Home Depot (store purchase), and that one worked.<br /><br />This probably works on most refrigerators, but not on mine.<br /><br />amazon gave us a refund for this item, and we did not have to send it back.",20
positive,"I have not ""tried"" this yet, as it is a gift. I am happy with the item though. It appears to be very functional. Easy to slide. The shipping was super fast. I recommend this company highly!",20
negative,"Came dented, lived with that. Then died after a year and a half.",20
positive,Fit very good,20
positive,These hangers were easy to install and fit perfectly. Much less expensive than ordering through a local dealer.,20
positive,Worked perfect in my coffee machine,20
positive,"Fast Delivery!!!  OEM Parts, and Resonable Price!!",20
positive,"I've been using this ice maker for almost a week now , it is so quiet , fast  making the ice and love the lite up screen so I can see it at night with out putting on the light",20
positive,"Love it. This dishwasher came with everything needed to connect it directly to the kitchen faucet. It fits perfectly well on any countertop space next to the faucet and you do not have to pay for professional installation.  However, if you have a big family this might be a little too small for you.",20
positive,"Just as described fit perfectly at a great price.  I compared to other similar product but they couldn't have been any better, and definitely didn't beat the price.",20
negative,"Well, I have now had two of these.  They last about 2 weeks.  The coffee is great, but the product is junk.  Nothing but problems. Wish I could rate it lower than one star.  VERY DISSAPOINTING PRODUCT!!!",20
negative,Good purchase,20
negative,I had previously wrote a very negative review and said it would be better just to use aluminum foil.  I wrote too quickly.  I was disappointed that the product was not as sturdy as I anticipated but I have been using them and they are ok.  Didn't know how to erase the bad review so I just wrote a second review.,20
positive,"Our icemaker makes good ice, once again",20
positive,My doorway is too small for convenientional dryer/washer sizes so I went for compact ones. It takes longer to dry things but still does a great job. I'm very happy with my purchase!,20
positive,They work great with my older keurig.  I would buy again if I needed that many k-cups,20
positive,Great investment.  It’s very easy to clean and it’s more environmentally friendly than using paper filters.,20
negative,No e podido utilizarla esta rota,20
positive,Great dishwasher! Perfect for our small apartment kitchen.perfect! Really quiet!,20
positive,great product for a great price. highly recommend,20
negative,"Only had this washing machine a few days and used it once. Works great so far but I have one concern, Apparently the manufacturer of this washing machine Zolko offers no warranty for this product. Inquiries about a warranty brought me this response:<br />This ;product has a shelf life of one year.<br />One year??? And shelf life not a one year warranty. So there are saying that you should expect your washing machine to function as advertised for one year without any guarantees.<br />Like I stated it is working fine so far and I have no complaints about the product itself but if it breaks quickly I'm out of luck.",20
positive,Works great.,20
positive,directions print too small.  works great,20
positive,Second one I've purchased over the years. Good quality and a good price.,20
positive,They do not break or leave grinds in my coffee,20
positive,"Easy to install, fits, and better price than a GE one.",20
positive,so cute on the dishwasher-  now everyone in the house  knows if the dishes are clean or dirty!!!,20
positive,Like. Disposable.,20
negative,I bought this for my mother. And it was a bit difficult to understand at first. But takes forever to make ice. Not sure if that's how it works. But if it is. Then I'm not happy. I have a different one that my boyfriend bought me. And it's awesome!  A lil smaller. But makes ice cubes pretty quick,20
negative,Filters work and produce good coffee with the exception being fine grounds will pass through filter.  Best for coarse ground coffee and I find it difficult to compost grounds because they are embedded in filter fabric.  Not quite ready for prime time.,20
positive,Perfect fit for our GE refrigerator.,20
positive,"I never knew this item existed!  For the past two years, I have been making cold brew coffee.  It was a chore.  I would add the coffee to the cold water, give it a stir, and wait for 24 hours.  Then I would have to pour the water and coffee grounds through a strainer.  I would then pour the cold brew through yet another strainer to make sure that no coffee grounds remained.  Oh my goodness, what a difference the Cold Brew Coffee Maker Filter Premium Organic Cotton Nut Milk Bag Reusable 9.5&#34; x 6&#34; - 2 Pack has made in my cold brew preparation.  All I had to do it  put the coffee in the bag, tighten the drawstring, put it in the container, and add cold water.  After waiting for a day, I pulled the bag out and poured the coffee into the dispenser.  No need to strain any grounds at all!  I rinsed the bag and it is hanging up to dry ready for my next batch.  It couldn't have been any easier!<br />I always count on reviews when I purchase new products from Amazon and I know that other buyers do as well. My reviews are based on my personal use of the product and I am not obligated to give a good rating, only a honest one! If you feel that my review has helped you, please click on yes below.",20
negative,"This is a nice looking range hood, but I am underwhelmed by the fan.  On high, it keeps up with normal cooking emissions, but is pretty loud.  On low, the fan is quiet, but ineffectual.  The lights are nice and bright and installation was easy.  We installed it at the height that was specified in the instructions, but we may try lowering it to see if it improves the exhaust fan function.<br />I expected more from Broan for the price.",20
negative,But for the price is ok.,20
negative,"The filter I tried out of a 3 pack leaked inside and I reinstalled in at least a dozen times and the pressure it built up was incredible, thus causing water to leak out of the dispenser as well. Sent back and ordered the real GE product.",20
positive,"My husband was very pleased with some of the features on this item, especially relating to installation. He could not wait to get it installed and I enjoy using it.",20
negative,"I purchased this item and it lasted for about 5 months before it died. So, I bought another one, I have my fingers crossed that this one will last. I suspect that the item is another counterfeit like so many products seem to be on Amazon anymore. I wish Amazon would put together a fraud protection team to protect its customers. Buyer beware!!",20
positive,The filters fit perfectly and the directions were clear and easy to follow.,20
positive,FIT VERY WELL. GREAT PRICE,20
positive,Could be OEM.,20
positive,Super simple to use and just what I needed!,20
positive,"Compatible with my refridg, just one step better than what it came with, I like that.",20
positive,"It is only 6 feet long, fine if it is enough but for year 2014 dishwasher you will need longer( depending on he model).",20
positive,"These things are awesome, work great with my Keurig.  I am picky about coffee, and love the convenience of the Keurig, so I am no longer limited by  k cup selection.",20
positive,Easy to use,20
positive,Fast shipping and great quality.,20
positive,Great product at a great price,20
positive,Ot installed yet,20
positive,I replaced a broken door switch watching a youtube vid saving myself at least $100 for a appliance tech to do same replacement.,20
positive,"Could never find 4 cup filters in local stores. Always wound up using the bigger 8 cup filters. Although they could fit, they were a bit of a pain. Finally decided to order these 4-cup filters online and am glad I did. These are much easier to use. They separate easily and fit perfectly.",20
positive,"This mini fridge is awesome. Be careful with the temperature, you don't need to put it all the way up as it gets very very cold almost to freezing point lol.",20
positive,I was looking for a alternative to the super expensive filters. Gave these a shot and I have one filter left and couldn’t be happier with the filters and packaging.,20
positive,Perfect for small apartments that don't have washer/dryer hookups. Really easy to use but does suck having to fill it up if it's not next to a running water source. It does make noise but as long as you load it right and not put too much in then it won't be too loud. Overall a good product.,20
positive,Does a good job.  it did start making a loud clicking noise after about a year and completely stopped about 6 months later.  I'm ordering again b/c the price is very good.  I've replaced before using a local retailer who's price was twice as much and didn't last any longer.  I think these ice makers are just not designed to last very long.  I'd recommend this product as long as you don't expect it to last forever.,20
positive,As good or better than factory,20
positive,The product was what I was looking for it came quick and very in expensive,20
positive,It's been installed a couple months now.  Both lights and fan work well.  I've only needed the low speed.,20
negative,Watch out buyer.<br /><br />Your clothes will be one giant corkscrew because the lint trap doesn't set far enough down -<br /><br />I'd look at a different company,20
positive,Fits great.  Third time I had to buy this part from them. Keeps breaking after a couple years. It might be because I am putting too much weight on it.,20
negative,"The picture displayed is the factory original (OEM) valve and the description reads OEM but it is not.  The OEM is made by Invensys Controls and the one shipped was not Invensys but instead an aftermarket valve with no manufacturer name imprinted.  I contacted Amazon and it was easy to return, refunded my money and they even paid return shipping.  I had previously bought a replacement valve that only lasted about 2 months and this one was the exact valve I had ordered previously.  This time, I made sure (from the picture and description of the part) that the valve I ordered was OEM.  I don't know if it's just the luck of the draw or what but like I said, the one I received was not factory OEM.",20
positive,Works great. Nice and compact and quieter than expected.,20
positive,"Other an a little noisy, it works great.",20
positive,these hoses fit perfect on my washing machine and are long enough for a stackable set. fast shippng,20
positive,Will see how long filter last.  So far all is good,20
positive,"This was purchased to be a beer fridge and hold the occasional bottle of wine. It has exceeded our expectations. It cooled very quickly. I love that it has a light. Something i missed in the description is the fact that is has a lock!! We are holding mostly bottles in it right now, but there is no issue with room!",20
positive,great product except it needs to be replaced too often may be philly water is too impure very expensive as compared to kenmore,20
positive,"Great price, easy to clean, does what it is supposed to.",20
negative,"This is just a rolled ""thing."" My expectations could have been off. I thought it would be a lightweight, metal. And carved. It is just plastic.",20
positive,Gave some to my sister and We both love them,20
positive,I love it it help me alot to wash and dry my son emergency cloths<br />And it save me a laundry trip,20
positive,"Exactly what I need to get the dryer fixed. The idler pulley (a real wheel) is a even better design than the original one (no wheel, just smooth half-circular mental that belt glide through).<br /><br />EDIT: 12/12/2014 - After putting 1 year and 9 month of the new idler pulley into service, the idler pulley's axle is seizing up and make high pitch noise when running the dryer. Has to remove it and use the original old one to get rid of the noise. I guess the old design is meant for some good reasons after all. No turning parts no squeaking noise. I'd recommend not to use the new wheel-turning pulley if the existing one has nothing wrong. Hope my feedback is helpful for anyone out there.",20
positive,As expected,20
positive,"We needed a new stovetop exhaust fan when we remodeled our 30 year old kitchen.  This one fit the bill, and we are impressed with the quality for the price of this non-ducted to the outside exhaust fan.",20
positive,Looks and feels very solid. Does the job well. Wished I would have bought it sooner.,20
positive,Exactly what I needed...quick shipping!,20
positive,"I only spend few minutes replaced broken one , and no tool necessary , just by hand like instruction<br />No more leaking ~~！",20
positive,"Good product, much cheaper than purchasing Samsung filter.",20
positive,Best money I've EVER spent on Amazon...Thanks!!,20
positive,The keurig filters were much less money than at BB&B.,20
positive,Bought this to go with a new InSinkErator that we also purchased here on Amazon. Our plumber hooked everything up and it is working great! We didn't want to have to cut the countertop to install some other button that may go obsolete if we ever upgrade disposals. Works great with the button on the back splash. Very happy with this solution to installing a button for our new disposal.,20
positive,"Worked for me, thank goodness.  I almost paid 3 times as much from a local store but saw this one while I was on the phone.  Very easy to switch out and worked out great!",20
positive,Good,20
negative,Doesn't hold the coffee long enough for full flavor,20
positive,It was my understanding that I was to receive a pack of three filters an only received one unit.,20
positive,Great product. Easy to install. Great value.,20
positive,FAST DELIVRY  AND FULL VALUE FOR THE COST.,20
positive,"They seemed like they might be a bit small, but in fact they are a good fit and work really well.  Much nicer than disposable paper filters which came with the product.",20
negative,"Installed this and couldn't use because the water stayed cloudy through several gallons of water and tasted horrible. Went to home depot, bought a new one, installed and after about a gallon of cycling the water through, clearer water. Requested refund",20
positive,Works perfectly. The price was the lowest I could find anywhere.,20
negative,Both of the shelves I ordered do not fit my Frigidaire refrigerator. They are loose and the shelves kept falling out. They might fit other brands better.,20
positive,"I have been using my Aero Press for almost 10 years and was not sure anything could improve it,  but Love this add on! I was concerned about a metal filter and how it would affect the taste of the coffee, but it's great, and even creates crema when I depress the plunger, which I didn't expect. Only problem was the tightness of the fit, I thought I must have had an odd sized Aero Press but with a little force I was able to attach it.... but now I'm not sure I can get it off again, but am able to clean it without having to disassemble..... for now. Will probably try something more aggressive in the near future. But overall very happy with this purchase.",20
positive,"I love this ice-maker. It is quiet and efficient. Once full, the 7-minute ice making cycle only comes on once every hour or so. It's so convenient to always have ice. I got rid of all my ice cube trays in my freezer! I suggest using filtered water for the freshest tasting ice.",20
positive,Order the end arrived on time easing to install,20
positive,Fit my Kenmore front load washer great. No more leaking water in to the tub when not being used.  Do recommend this product.,20
positive,Solved my problem. Cheaper than a new dryer. I am glad that I found this motor.,20
positive,This is perfect for our granit countertop. No drilling,20
positive,[[VIDEOID:6349ca17019c2b70d3ae2c7b329aeb52]] This product is worth buying as it really have helped me stoping my washing machine from walking forward and is now able to stay in one position when it’s spinning and vibrating it helps keeps it steady I’m happy for this stress reliever,20
positive,They work great in my Chemex drip brewer. I like that they are natural and unbleached filters.,20
positive,Excelente,20
positive,Just what I ordered,20
positive,Ok,20
positive,"These fit well, just plug in and heat it up.  With new drip pans now makes stovetop look like new.<br />Works great, sits level, fit perfect in the new drip pan notch opposite the plug on the unti.",20
positive,"Fantastic, and the seller was so very helpful when we contacted him. We have been using it for almost a year without any problems or concerns",20
positive,"I wish I had ask the question if you could secure the lid.  The lid just sits upon the basket, no way to secure the lid.  When I put the basket into the hot water the lid just floats off.  Most of the loose tea ends up in the water.  I have to strain the loose tea from the water each time.  Will keep it, but won't recommend.",20
positive,This works great. It fit my humidifier perfectly. I will be buying this again.,20
positive,Installed easy. Direct fit replacement heater coil.,20
negative,They did not fit the mixer at all. I had all the correct info. they should have fit just fine and didn't work at all. Very disappointed!!,20
positive,Works perfectly for our refrigerator.,20
negative,"Unit is noisy, produces a lot of heat, when u open the ice tray it makes a mess. Ice is perfect.",20
positive,Worked great,20
positive,Instructions hard to read but pretty much self explanatory took about thirty minutes to put together,20
positive,Easy to wash and use over and over again!,20
positive,I love my reusable keurig cups. No more guilt over dumping plastic k-cups that aren’t recyclable. The coffee actually tastes better!,20
positive,Seller shipped item right away And it arrived promptly! Nice to have my refrigerator working again!,20
positive,"Arrived with bad compressor, paid $100 for service call to confirm that, and can’t find anywhere a contact to confirm they received it after we returned it weeks ago!",20
positive,Purchased this cooktop almost 2 years ago. I installed it myself and we’ve had zero issues. Love the quickness of induction and will never go back to a radiant cooktop.,20
positive,Easy to use for big two side refrigerator,20
positive,"I purposely ordered a white one, but received a black one instead.  That being said, it's easy to install and easy to use.",20
positive,Just what I needed- I used the larger seal- my washer is an 04 kenmore.  I thought the top seal would be the bad one- but it was this side one- at the motor drive.  Had to dig the old one out with screwdriver.  And had to use sealer ( not the tightest fit.)  It is probably a little better than the orig equipment.  I had oil sprayed on the inside of the cabinet and the floor.,20
positive,Slid in place and fixed one issue,20
positive,"so far so good! I must say, it has saved me a lot of money!<br />I highly recommend this machine to every one. I told my friends about it, and they also bought it.",20
positive,My LG washer started filling (slowly) with water when not being run. I determined that the hot water valve didn't fully close so I purchased this item. Worked like a charm.,20
positive,"Received the seal that I needed. It fit the washing machine as advertised<br /><br />I did want to mention that the spanner wrench that I bought for this job (Supco TB123A Spanner Wrench ) said it was a universal spanner wrench, but it did not fit the 1 and 11/16th nut that must be removed to replace the tub seal. If you need this wrench, it would be wise to read reviews on some of the other wrenches for sale to see if they fit this nut better.<br /><br />I made this wrench work though but wrapping a couple of the sides several times in duct tape. This helped fill in the gaps between the wrench and the nut and also held the two part wrench together. Its also important to note that I had to hit the wrench relatively hard many times in order to get the nut to even budge. I just wanted to include in case someone else experiences the same as me.<br /><br />I also wanted to note that I thought the tub seal was the issue to my leaking washing machine. The fact that I had the top load washer door closed, I didn't notice that the water was slightly overflowing the tub and causing water to come out of the bottom of the washer. It turned out to actually be a small amount of build up where the air tube connected to the tub. This kept the pressure switch from being activated. As a result, the tub continued to fill and would not agitate as usual. The simple and free fix was sucking up water into a straw and blowing out the debris clogging the small plastic piece connected to the outer tub (the location where the air tube attaches to the tub)<br /><br />If the tub seal is needed, I would recommend buying a new split ring as the old ring broke (due to corrosion) as I removed it to replace the tub seal.",20
positive,Just like the original,20
positive,"I ordered these filters for a Samsung RF4287HARS model refrigerator. I did have an issue with the filters that I received , but once I contacted the company, their excellent customer service quickly resolved the issue. I will definitely buy these again.",20

positive,This product was easy to install and it works great🤘🤩🤘,20
negative,We purchased this product oct 28 2018.  We purchased this and the fuses replaced both items and yesterday the heating element almost catvhes fire and is obviously out.  Seriously we barely got 15 months use out of it before going bad and lucky us the return window is only one month,20
positive,I really like this egg drawer. It expands to fit any shelf and is so convenient!,20
positive,Fit older Lady Kenmore compactor perfect. Holds up to anything put in the compactor. Would buy again.,20
positive,Fixed my dishwasher!,20
positive,Fits perfectly,20
positive,Fine --no problems--best price. 16 additional word requirement makes no sense--I have nothing more to say. What a waste of words.,20
positive,"Great video of step by step install online, brought my washer back to life",20
positive,"I'm having trouble with the ice machine, there is no information sent as to who to contact, Don't have any info in book that came with it, no company name nothing. Very poor customer service. Who do I contact for help.  Sent this letter , they answered it by  asking for a photo of the ice maker which I did 2 weeks ago now no reply from them.",20
positive,Does just what I needed . Keeps the frig working when temps go below 25!,20
positive,"Right product, fit and is operating correctly.",20
negative,"The picture shows that this kit fits the Whirlpool # WTW7300XW0. That may be true, but it came no where near fitting my Whirlpool Cabrio model WTW7300DW0. For that, you need to buy the full ""gearcase assembly"" not available on Amazon.",20
positive,"Great value for the money. Easy to insert, and remove.  The hardest part is remembering when to change the filter.",20
positive,I started with these and for some reason switched to the other brand of foil caps. After using brand X I came back to these. These foil caps just seem to be stronger with a better adhesive.,20
positive,"Fits my 53mm La Spaziale Dream porta filter just fine. I’m able to get 21.5 grams in my triple IMS basket with out the shower head screw making contact with the screen. Still forming opinion on whether a puck screen has an effect on extraction, and flavor of shot. So far, using pre infusion & the puck screen results in a well saturated and extracted puck of grounds.",20
positive,Makes my stove look new,20
negative,This works to use your own coffee and its not hard to clean.  It fits properly. I dont use it as often as I thought I would.,20
positive,The filter cam with great reviews and has not let us down.  We brew a large 12 cup pot every weekend and we enjoy our coffee...,20
positive,"It worked as it should, though I still place a paper filter in with it because the product alone leaves a slight film of coffee at the bottom of the cup.",20
positive,This was to replace a thermostat that did not function correctly and would not keep fridge and freezer cold.  It was fairly easy to replace with just a few tools and functions just as it should with no issues.,20
positive,Quick shipping. Item was as described good quality works as it should.  What else can be said about a metal pitcher.,20
negative,"The item was as described, however the mounting hole tabs got bent out of shape in shipping and had to be straitened.",20
positive,Looks nice and very easy to install,20
positive,"My local repair shop wanted $$$ for this door shelf, got here for half the cost, perfect fit, looks great and original.",20
negative,Cup will fit into my coffee maker but when using coffee power spills into pot. Coffee comes with powder while drinking. I always have to leave 2-3 last sips of the coffee as it has powder.,20
negative,Broke as soon as I hooked it on.  for some reason the quality is less than the OEM ones.<br />I just made one out of wire.  should have in the first place.,20
positive,Fits my GE Profile refrigerator perfectly,20
positive,I needed to be able to set up my coffee pods at the beginning of the week for my morning coffee and these work great on my mini Keurig coffee maker.<br />I still have these coffee filters two years later and they are still in great shape and going strong. They are a great product for a great price.,20
positive,They were just as advertised!,20
negative,This is the only kind filters that I ever bought. They use to come well packaged. Now they have cut the box size in half and are squishing the filters to where you have to reshape them to use them and they are hard to separate.  I guess I need to find another brand.  It makes me mad to spend $30+ on something that the quality has went so far down hill.  Wasn't expecting it to be different.  They didn't have to cut the box down as far as they did since they didn't drop the price at all!!!!,20
negative,"I loved the basket until it broke at the weld, just like other reviews stated.  It was nice to skip having to separate the paper coffee filter In the morning.  However, cleaning the grounds out of the basket was not the easiest feat.  Great idea but the product needs some refining.",20
positive,Nice,20
negative,"Product looked like original, just did not work.",20
negative,"Para salir del apuro temporalmente está bien. Pero es más rígida y más corta que la original (de mi lavadora) así que no es el mismo funcionamiento. Pero para ahorrar muchos dólares, es buena opción.",20
positive,this will help keep my stove top clean,20
positive,The high speed fan is noisier than what expected,20
positive,Arrived as expected,20
positive,"I use these to handle my 2000ml flask while making yeast starters. They have excellent heat protection and grip on the glass as opposed to regular oven gloves. (which cost me my 1000ml flask and a huge mess on the kitchen floor) I highly recommend them for handling hot pots/pans etc. but do be aware they are NOT liquid proof, so, if you spill hot liquid on them while handling your pots & pans it will come through and burn!",20
negative,"I mounted this under the cabinet and liked it for a while. I'm patient and will put it back together when it pops apart. He is not. When it comes apart on him, I spend five minutes finding the filters because he takes them out in protest. The sticky doesn't last long with daily use and I lost the extra ones right away. I tell him just have a wet hand and give it a light pinch, only one will come out. Does he bother? No. It's become one of our little battles :(",20

negative,So I guess if you dont mind water that taste like burnt plastic chemicals this is a fine choice or if you dont plan on drinking the water either....I actually wanted to drink the water but this filter probably adds more contamination to the water its tastes like plastic burnt chemicals.. Spend the cash for a better filter this will just leave you thirsty with a bad taste in your mout😓🤬,20
positive,"Does its job, and has a little area around the side of the screen for air in case the screen is completely covered by lint.<br />I just use it in the winter to reclaim the heated air into the basement, instead of venting outside.",20

positive,"Just what I expected, fits as expected in the Keurig 2.0. Individually wrapped, which I was pleased about.",20
positive,"the water pressure has increased with these filters so I'm hopeful they will be better than the last brand I bought, I just can't justify the price of the LG OEMs.",20
positive,"I paid premium for this item thinking that it is a genuine article and my peace of mind is worth the extra bucks. For whatever reason, water tastes horrible. I thought it would go away after a while, but well, a month later it still doesn't. I regret buying this item.<br /><br />Update Nov 2016: even the best of us make mistakes. I had not installed the filter properly. I pushed it in and voilà, it started to actually filter water.

positive,The replacement water dispenser fits great and price for the package is fair. I change it every 6 months as suggested.,20
positive,This works great. I have more pressure than was ever with the filter that cost me $49.00 for 1. I got 3 for less than the one.,20

positive,These fit our trash compactor perfectly. They were the exact replacement that we were looking for. The photo is a great representation of what you will get.,20

positive,"I love homemade iced tea but hate the hassle of waiting to hear the water and everything else that goes along with it. So I decided to try brewing with cold water sort of like the ""sun tea"" method we used we I was a kid. The Tube is a great product. It's constructed well...for some reason I had to squeeze it...and the capacity is just perfect for the half gallon big mouth Mason jar. It can hold a good number of tea bags and it works perfectly with loose tea as well.",20

negative,"*Update 11/20/22<br /><br />The part failed again. I replaced it with a genuine. Avoid this cheap copy.<br /><br />I replaced my broken all plastic coupler with this heavy duty replacement part. It arrived next day and the process was fairly easy. I have never fixed a washer before.<br /><br />Unfortunately the part failed about halfway through the first load of laundry!<br /><br />I liked the idea of metal inserts in the plastic coupler to prevent rounding off the flat spots.<br /><br />I disliked when the metal insert on the transmission side separated (see pictures) causing me to do the repair twice in a day.<br /><br />I believe the reason it came apart was due to the coupler not being fully seated on the transmission and although the motor snapped back onto the transmission easily enough the lack of clearance may have driven the plastic off of the metal.<br /><br />On the first repair it was difficult to just push the parts on using just fingers. So I used a plastic screwdriver handle to tap the new parts onto the shafts, taking care to not tap the plastic body or prongs to avoid damaging them.<br /><br />On the second repair I was able to reuse the failed part after I reinserted the metal back into the plastic. Then I used a deep metal socket to lightly drive the coupler all the way flush on second repair (see pictures(<br /><br /> The first load of laundry after the second repair worked flawlessly.",20
negative,"Despite being the correct manufacturer made part for our refrigerator, these did not fit as they should.<br />I've ordered these multiple times, they are the correct part for our refrigerator model (and yes, I checked that multiple times). The last order of the exact same part gave us quite some grief as they would not fit. We noticed the collar has a shallower groove than previous versions, and were able to make it fit with a little whittle work using a utility knife.<br />Once installed, these are great. The water quality is noticeably better, and the filter has a rapid filtration rate.",20
negative,"I ordered a new filter and ordered the brand recommended as original and what not. Well, the first didn’t work right. Made me think it was the fridge. Had the fridge serviced, cost me a couple hundred bucks. Then told it was the filter. Ordered another of the same filter. Same stuff, slow water and almost no ice.  I was fed up and ordered a no name brand filter, and boom problem solved. Will never buy this again.",20
positive,better than using a glass :),20

positive,We are pleased with our new filter replacement- came in a 3 pack- so a great value. The filter was easy to install- no complaints!,20

negative,"Updated<br />Product was ordered after dryer went out. Arrived within two days, easy to install and made my dryer dry again. This is the first replacement part I purchased for my dyer through amazon and would now continue going forward.

I was happy with the product at first, but after it lasting less than 60 days I will purchase through another company.",20

negative,"Oh why did we buy this pile of garbage!  LG has the worst customer service you can imagine.  If you don't believe me, buy this awful money pit and you too will have the opportunity to talk to them, several times.  Your brand new fridge will break soon after you install it in your kitchen and you'll say, &#34;why didn't I listen to the reviews&#34;?  If you buy this lemon you better buy two cause you'll need somewhere to store you food while the first one gets fixed.  Avoid this fridge.",20
positive,"Perfect fit, quick delivery!",20
positive,"This is my first stand alone ice maker - I got it because running out of ice at a party sucks and I wanted to have the ability to make more in advance.  When I ordered it, I didn't realize how quickly this thing can turn out the cubes!<br /><br />The design of the freezing system super-cools the steel cube forms while they are submerged so that the ice forms quickly, then removes them from the water and heats the metal slightly so they automatically pop out of the forms, very cool (and kind of fun to watch).  It does a batch of 9 cubes in about 10 minutes and starts back in again - in 30 minutes you have a bin of 27 cubes - this type of production is not possible in refrigerators systems I've owned before.<br /><br />Some things to be aware of - the device itself is not refrigerated so the ice starts to melt as soon as it comes out of the molds; this makes for ""wet"" cubes that can stick together a bit.  It's best used for rapidly making ice on demand - not an appliance you just leave on all the time. You also have to fill it manually with water using a pitcher so it won't run indefinitely on its own.<br /><br />I've had it in service for about a month and it gets daily to semi daily use.  So far it's running strong, I recommend it!",20
positive,Needed a wider range hood and this fits the bill.  It doesn't vent outside but that is OK for us.  My husband wanted to install it and it was a struggle but we made it.,20
positive,I have had stove counter gap covers before but none compare to these. They are silicone and stay where put and they are easy to clean.<br />So glad I decided to give them a try. Nothing will get down the side of the stove anymore! Love the black color which matches my stove!,20

He comes home from work sets warmers in the boots and by morning they are dry. This product works as promised. It was a good price as well. I would definitely buy again and recommend this product.,20

negative,"I really wanted this multi sensor to work as part of my SmartThings setup. Researched the device ahead of time. Found out from the SmartThings hub about the installation and monitoring issues. Went ahead and bought it anyway. Received the device in great condition. The first surprise was that the device does not come with batteries. I'm sure that this was mentioned somewhere on Amazon but they could've done a better job of making that clear. I was forced to use the included micro USB cable for installation. The device was detected as a z wave sensor. Installed it as an Aeotec multisensor into SmartThings. Tried to move this device to the living room. Sure enough, the original connection was lost. Re- installed the sensor in its new position. However, the device began to perform erratically. Abruptly stops communicating with the ST hub. Updated the device profile as suggested on the SmartThings forum. However, have not been able to get this thing to work. Eventually, the action button assembly broke due to the repeated use. Left with a lemon that is of no value and completely unreliable. Sadly, wasn't able to keep it going long enough to meaningfully test the  multi- sensor capability. Don't think that the z wave multi sensors are ready for prime time.",20

negative,"I bought this item because I have to remove the cold water line every month from the back of the washing machine to clean out the inlet filter because the new washer senses low water flow. This looked like the perfect solution! I took a chance since previous reviews suggest great results and others not so good. Well, I am on the side of junk! After so many iterations of different levels of tightness, I had a royal mess in the laundry room with water spewing everywhere with each iteration. I am returning for full refund and will build my own filter using metal hose parts.",20
positive,"Easy to install, good replacement part for my LG oven.",20
negative,"Filmsy aluminum foil, but  You get what you pay for.",20
positive,"We love this fridge. I think there were some reviews that sad that it didn't keep things cold, but we haven't had that problem at all. In fact, it keeps stuff ice cold and it's not turned up all the way. The glass did fog up when it was real humid out, but hasn't been a problem since. I would recommend it.",20

positive,Just works!,20
positive,"The heating element on my Frigidaire stacked laundry unit's dryer burned out.  I looked up the service manual online and saw I would need to take out the drum to get at the heating element.  Over my 67 years I've learned to replace the parts I remove with new parts.  It saves having to do this again in the near future.  On the Frigidaire OEM website, each piece of this kit was sold separately and for a lot more money.  I also replaced the drive belt even though it was not broken.  All told, heating element, rear bearing drum kit, and drive belt cost me around $50.00.  My son and I repaired the dryer in about an hour and a half.  We have a dryer that works like new even though it is more than ten years old.",20

positive,Works!,20
negative,The freezer stays frozen with ice around it. I realized after purchase the true reason for the tray inside the fridge. It’s for catching water from the freezer that freezes and thaws constantly. What it doesn’t catch goes in the bottom of the fridge. Door doesn’t seal properly and it’s louder than expected. I’m not happy with my purchase and wouldn’t recommend purchasing.,20

positive,We love our ice maker.  It was a great addition to our kitchen when our almost new Samsung refrigerator freezes over and doesn't produce ice.  This handy little appliance makes ice rather quickly.  Our family uses ice in everything we drink so using the old fashion way of freezing the water in the trays just wasn't going to work for us.,20
positive,"Popped right into the dryer, no issues or size worries.",20
negative,"We only had this ice maker for 6 weeks and it stopped working. And actually, only used it 4 weekends as its at out lake house and turn it off every week when we leave.  Amazon will not refund because its out of the 30 day window and the company is NO HELP!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! BYE $599.00",20
negative,I can't believe I didn't read the reviews for the twine or the dispenser before buying. The ball of twine is huge and doesn't fit the dispenser even if I used a jack hammer - what a crazy thing to make a dispenser that doesn't fit your own twine. Wacky. Other than that the twine is fine...,20

positive,"UPDATE: Purchased Pike place the coffee ground version to use with these. Tasted perfect. Was not light like the other coffee. Meaning it’s not the filters that made the coffee light, it was just the coffee type. The 5 stars stay :)<br /><br />These filters work. I have a fake Keurig machine lol had it for almost 2 years, use it for k-cups, does the job. I lost the filter it came with so I stopped using the bag ground coffee. Glad I found this gem and I can use ground coffee again. I was afraid they wouldn’t work since it’s not an original keurig machine. It does have the shape of a K-cup so I assumed the machine would think it’s a K-cup, so I gave them a try. Happy to report that they worked! Only “downside” I noticed is that the coffee is not as strong. Usually with my pike place k-cup I use 10 oz, and it’s perfect. When I pour creamer, I need about 2 tablespoons for it to be to my liking. I’m trying this Dunkin’ donut one for the new filters. The instructions on the coffee bag suggested 6 oz for 1 heaping tablespoon. I put almost 2 whole tablespoons. I could already tell the coffee did not look dark enough when I got it from the machine. It took the tiniest amount of creamer for the color to go super light. So the coffee did not come out as strong as I usually like. I did not deduct a star for this because I’m not sure at the moment if it’s just the new coffee I’m trying this out with, or it is something to do with the filter. I’ll keep playing with them and update soon.",20

negative,"The stress and anxiety over this machine has been tremendous. Cant say it does the job bec was only able to try it out once. It appeared the clothes didn’t rinse properly; but it can also be the detergent. My biggest problem with the machine is that it is NOT portable. I bought it based on measurements to fit in custom made closet(1foot from bathroom). Intended to be hidden out of sight. There are no handles or divets like in my old AvanIu machine. There are 2 small wheels in front of the machine, which are shorter than the rubber feet and are engineered in front of the machine. This requires you to pick up the machine rather than wheel it. Weird, even if wheels were properly placed you’d have to tip it back wards(horrible). I McGivered  it with a dolly but  again no handles on machine to maneuver it., there’s a 1inch diff between floor and bathroom door kick and again can’t lift the machine or tilt it. It has to be lifted, ruined my bathroom door kick trying to swivel it in. Im defeated, as I’ve exhausted all engineering and hacking  to make this machine work. Bought new wheels for it today and i will see if i can swap out the rubber feet see if that works. Alternatively ill be requesting company pick up their product as Im not lugging it down 6 flights of stairs.",20
positive,These fit my percolator and work perfectly!,20
positive,"I purchased this product because I lost the screw on filter holder on my other one on my French press. Secura French Press that I purchased here on Amazon.<br /><br />The plunger was too short for that French press but the filters, metal and mesh, and the screw on holder fit my original plunger. So it worked as a replacement part. I believe it would fit most average size coffee presses. I wish that the length of the plunger was listed.",20
positive,Does exactly what I wanted it to. I can tell the temperature when frothing milk without needing a separate thermometer.,20

However that one cracked after about two weeks, and I was unfortunately out of the 30 day replacement. I am now stuck with my second broken part and I'm still not able to get water out of my fridge",20
negative,Purchased the #4 filter. I’m not sure what the hype is about. Used it in a Cuisinart coffee maker and a Breville coffee maker and the coffee was awful. Expensive and definitely not worth the cost.,20
positive,Real review lol,20
positive,"I bought these wheels because the original wheels in the dishwasher were beginning to lean when we moved the bottom rack back and forth.  The original wheels weren't the problem: the original mounting clips were wearing out.  The new clips that came in this pack are strong and a different design so they might last longer than the original ones.  The new wheels are all of the wide variety as opposed to the four skinny wheels plus wide ones I had originally.  Took the empty rack out, unsnapped all the old ones, mounted the clips to the wheel before mounting to the rack and I was back in business.",20

positive,"I have always washed all the crud off dishes before I put them in a dishwasher.  I live in an apartment and have gone without a dishwasher for many years now.  But my nephew recommended this for me.  I absolutely love it!  It fits nicely on my cupboard next to the sink.  I am completely amazed at how clean my dishes come out...WITHOUT PREWASHING THEM!  I have back problems and not having to bend over to empty the dishwasher is really a lifesaver.  This was one of the least expensive dishwashers I could find, but don’t let the price fool you.  It is wonderful!",20
positive,Good product,20
positive,Fast shipping.  Filters fit great.  We have ordered from this company before and will continue to do so.,20
positive,looks very sturdy might last awhile,20

negative,"It washes clothes. And that's it.<br />Lock feature can't be bypassed. I'm sorry, I didn't realize I was an infant and needed my washing machine locked. Can't get into it to add anything without jumping through hoops. Once you do, it wastes water by adding more! There's NO WAY to let a load soak! Pausing the cycle, stopping the cycle, the washer still drains the water five minutes later. Sometimes there are stains that need soaking!!<br />And it's noisy as hell. The thing rocks and the drain pipe knocks against the back because there's no way to secure it to the washer! Piece of junk.",20

negative,"I've been working on the squeaking in my dryer.  After greasing the original rollers, I finally decided to replace the belt and rollers.  Straight forward enough to install.  With the new belt, rollers and pulley wheel installed, I now get a different sound in my dryer.  I need to take it apart again to see what's the cause.  I suspect that it might be the belt as it is thinner than the original Maytag belt.  Does it work?  Yes but not sure about the quality of the replacement parts.",20
positive,Item came right as promised and in perfect condition.The brush is very easy to use and coils nicely to store.,20
positive,This is great,20
negative,Developed a leak which ruined carpeting in the closet behind the refrigerator wall. Repairman said was a crack in the filter housing caused by non-authorized filters,20
positive,"This product works as it should. I use it to move my gas fire pit around. I do however wish the legs were able to be screwed in about 1/2 inch more, but not reducing my star rating because of that. Since the casters are a bit small, I did reduce the rating by 1 star.<br />It was pretty easy to put together (about 5 minutes)",20
positive,Very easy install!,20
positive,"I have 2 of these (in different places) and use them daily.  I find that washing 4-5 towels at a time works best.  I've also found that powder detergent works best, but that's just me.  I've been using mine several times a day for several months and they still work great!",20
positive,Love it,20
positive,Great value. These are hard to find. And at a good price.,20
positive,very convenient!,20
positive,"In the description I read this was an exact replacement, but for my Maytag refrigerator, it seemed to be more of a universal fan motor. I have no complaints of the functionality or the performance. It operates at a higher rpm than my original fan, which is great, the more air movement the better. The only issue I had was getting my fan blades mounted perfectly onto the new motor, otherwise with the higher rpm, the fan blade needs to be perfectly cleaned & balanced, or it will vibrate & annoyed me like crazy. After several removes & remounts, I got the vibration to a minimum. Another thing was the wiring, my old fan had a simple 3 wire plug that plugged into it, this replacement had 2 wires coming out, no plug connection. That kinda left me scratching my head, but no big deal. I just cut the plug off & used wire nuts for the electrical connections. But all in all, for the price, you can't beat it. It just wasn't quite a exact fit for me, that may be my mistake in the part # translation from maytag to whirlpool, etc. But the condensor fan motor is working great, my fridge is cooling great, & not running non stop like before.",20
positive,Easy to install and super fast shipping!,20
negative,they are what they are supposed to be,20
negative,"Have only had this dryer for a few weeks, but our electric bill already jumped by hundreds of dollars (and that only covered the first week we had it). I think it's because the dryer can take over 3 hours to dry even small loads (like 2 towels, 3 pairs of jeans, etc.), so it feels like we are constantly having to run it. We have a normal set up - stacked washer/dryer in a large closet, with a lint vent that has been cleaned in the past 6 months. Had to replace the previous dryer because a belt broke, but otherwise, it worked fine in the same space.",20

positive,I definitely recommend. The scoop fills the cup perfectly and the cups work great!,20

negative,We have had a Holmes humidifier for years and it finally died last year as it sprung a leak.  I did not see anything similar from Holmes as I think Sunbeam changed to the Honeywell brand for the home humidifier like this one.  Set up was easy had to do a little assembly.  Turned it on in the afternoon by the morning the unit was dead.  We attempted to contact the company for warranty but they never contacted us back.  Looks like I am going to have to check out another brand.  Kind of sad that this did not work out,20

positive,"These keep your stovetop under the burners cleaner. I love these and have been using them for several years. If they get too dirty or messed up, I just change them out, but they do clean up well for the most part! Unless it’s something really sticky or messy, it’s gonna almost fall right off when you wipe this down..",20
negative,Doesn't work properly in the Keurig K55. Seems there's a bit of a gap between the filter holder and the part of the machine that rests on top of it when you close the machine to make your coffee. This results in water leaking inside of that area. Also the water seems to kind of spit out when brewing which to me seems that the water pump is straining to get the water through.,20

The gasket is amazing - thin bead of caulk on siding-side, screw it into your pre-drilled holes and you have an excellent weather seal with easy access to clean out lint (as if most people ever do that).

Purchased this model to replace an older model by Honeywell.<br />The older model could bring the humidity up to 55% in my bedroom.<br />This model can bring it up to 45% by the time I wake up.<br />Don’t know if the humidistat is not working as well as the older model.<br />But 30-40 percent is supposed to be the best setting anyway.<br />Uses the same filter as the older model.,20
positive,"Works fine. It went in easily, the water flow through it works great (we had tried an offbrand but couldn't get any water out so went back to GE). The water taste clean too.",20
positive,Perfect replacement for my yellowed cover,20
negative,"I purchased this non-oem replacement part in hopes to get the repair done quicker and found it was close to the original but not 100%. As others noted the shaft is longer and spring is compressed differently because of that. The spring and washer materials were questionable, not clear if they were actually stainless steel, so rather than have this thing fail yet again I decided to return and purchase the OEM part, wait a few more days.",20
positive,"Easy to install, works perfectly and price was amazing!",20
positive,"It came on time , I installed it and it worked fine.",20
positive,Came in the description described.  Definitely seems to do a good job filtering out the chlorine taste in the city water.,20
negative,"I will not buy these filters again.  First, one filter was faulty and I can say that the seller handled the matter quickly by sending me out a replacement which I appreciated their great customer service.  But now, the filter they sent out has gone bad which has made the water taste very bad.  The first month was fine but within one day, we notice a foul taste and it only got worse.  I called the manufacturer to trouble shoot the problem and we decided to try a LG filter to see if it will fix the problem.  Yes, I had to spend more but in this case it was worth it because our water is back to normal and taste like it should.  Saving money on cheaper replacement filters has ended up costing me more in the long run - lesson learned.",20

positive,Exactly what I needed. Great price.,20
positive,Super easy to install and great flavor,20
negative,"Even though we flushed it multiple times over multiple days, there were HUGE white flakes floating around in the water. Maybe we got a broken unit, but I saw one other review that said this exact thing. Pretty unbelievable that this passed through quality checks.",20

negative,"I have the original version of this filter (without the red rubber plug top) and it works great.<br /><br />This one, however, does not create a decent connection to my Keurig which results in water running AROUND the unit. You get one stream of coffee from the water that is injected into the filter, but you also get multiple streams of water that doesn't go through the coffee flowing down through the machine (in places water should not go) and sometimes into your cup (but mostly onto your counter).<br /><br />The filter and filter holder work just fine with my original cap, so I can at least make use of those, but the lid on this one needs to go directly into your trash can.",20
negative,Design flaw or bad one off? Don't know. Made it a bit harder to put the dryer back together. I'll try a different brand next time.,20
positive,"This is the matching freezer for the SideKicks refrigerator.  They look great side by side in our kitchen.  I love the extra room having a separate freezer gives us. We are in a rural area, so it is a 60-mile round trip to go grocery shopping.  I only go about once a week, and this freezer gives me the space to freeze enough to last until the next trip, and I can stock up on sale items.  The design is good and the left handle for the freezer and the right handle for the refrigerator work well and look good.  The expanse across for the two stainless steel doors might look barren if left unadorned, but we love the space to put a lot of magnetic picture holders on the two--our own personal Facebook pages in our kitchen you might say.  You might check out my comments on the SideKicksrefrigerator, too.  Great pair.  Highly recommend them if you have the space.",20
positive,"This review is for the MERAX mini washer with spin extracter.<br />My son bought this for me some weeks ago. We have both washed our clothes in it, as well as regular size sheets(one piece  at a time). It will wash the 2 pillow cases together. Two extra  large towels, (very thick) can be washed together. Just keep in mind you don't want to over pack with clothes. The clothes get cleaner when they agitate loosely. The amount of soap is considerably less than what I used when going to the laundromat, which means for me BIG savings on having to buy laundry products so often.<br />  This little machine is awesome!!! It gets clothes really clean, you can presoak or just soak your clothes in it, before or during the wash. I do the spin rinse in the spin side for 2 minutes, or until the water is clear then I turn off the water and let it extract all the water from the the clothes, when it's done they come out ready to air dry, and it doesn't take long for them to air dry since the extraction of water from the clothes is done very well.<br />  The machine it self is well made.  You have your water fill lines on the inside left showing small, medium, large loads. On the inside right towards the upper back there is a drain hole in case you accidentally over fill or forgot to shut water off that water will drain right down into the drain hose to wherever you drain your water. That's a nice little feature because we do have mishaps. The spin/extractor side is a metal tub which I thought was a nice feature also,  you use to see these in laundromats many eons ago. Not everyone wanted to heat dry their clothes.<br />  I like this machine because you are able to control how your clothes get washed, and how long they wash. This is a great help in maintaining our weekly laundry.<br />  The only negative thing is it doesn't have a lint trap, which is not bad, because we put one on the end of the drain hose, so the tub pipe doesn't get clog.  Maybe the next generation of this machine they will put one in.<br />  I was able to use this right out the box. Had an old washing machine adapter I put on the bathroom faucet, electric wire reached outlet with good amount of slack, and drain hose drop down in tub perfectly.  It sits on my bath chair in front of sink when I use it.<br />  I hope this helps you.",20
positive,Works great in our single cup keurig. Easier to clean than other reusable pods we have because it has less mesh. Appreciate that is all one piece too and lid is attached to body of cup.,20

It is very quiet hard to tell it is even on, but stuff in it is frozen and seems to be colder than my refrigerator's freezer.",20
